This section is about how to put a good training together taking into account the target audience, designing appropriate learning objectives and activities, and using and reusing relevant resources while taking into consideration licensing and attribution.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"7%20Teaching%20and%20Education/01_Lesson-Development/","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Teaching","Education"],"text":"Lesson Development This page is currently under construction The training curriculum is currently undergoing final revisions and quality checks.

Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Recognise the target audience and their learning needs Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Design a training for the target audience to meet the learning objectives Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Plan how to gather feedback for further improvement in lesson development Learning Objective 4 (LO4): Identify context-specific resources for training and use these to design learning activities Total Module Duration 3 hours Learning Objective 1 LO1: Recognise the target audience and their learning needs Learning Activities Presentation/video (15 mins): Start off with an introduction on why a trainer needs to identify their target audience, and how to identify the needs of a target audience. Explain that the trainer should be clear in what they want the target audience to achieve (10 mins). Reflection Activity (30 mins): In breakout groups of 3-4 participants, think about and discuss what possible target audiences Data Stewards might need to train and what training needs they could have. Exercise (15 mins): A hands on exercise to map out the purpose of the training need by identifying the target audience and their possible RDM needs. Use a planning template for this exercise (e.g. the EOSC synergy training template \u2013 Resource 3). Materials to Prepare Presentation on what is a target audience and why to consider their needs when designing a training. Activity and Exercise: Facilitate the learners to think of their context for trainings and consider the target audience and their possible training needs. Instructor Notes Presentation on target audience and learning needs: Once the Data Steward has identified what the problem is and why a training is needed they can design the learning objectives of the training. Then the next step is to identify the target audience. The trainer can highlight the importance of this so that the training can be best designed for that target audience to solve the identified problem together over the course of the training. It is important to assess the target audience's level of expertise. The prior knowledge will determine if a training will start with defining key concepts vs. building upon prior knowledge. As a trainer the data steward should also have to think of how best to deliver a training that meets the learning needs of the target audience (e.g. Think of busy professionals and how this will impact the design of the training). The trainer can develop a presentation using inspiration resources (Resource 1). Reflection Activity: The goal of the reflection activity is to get the learners to start thinking about current knowledge gaps in their institute that they could cover via trainings. Who would the target audience be? The trainer can use the resources to facilitate this activity (Resource 2, 3). You can make the exercise more interesting by asking learners to create a persona for the learners who they will train. Pick a persona and think about what this will mean in terms of training design. Exercise: The trainer can introduce some tools that can be used to identify the target audience and their training needs (Resources 2, 3).

Learning Objective 2 LO2: Design a training for the target audience to meet the learning objectives Learning Activities Presentation (30 mins): Introduction to creating learning objectives (for instance, using Bloom\\'s Taxonomy), emphasising the importance of using measurable verbs in designing learning objectives. Introduction to some examples of common learning activities and the role that learning activities play in meeting the learning objectives. Reflection activity 1 (15 mins): Instructor presents a learning objective. Evaluate whether this is a clear, measurable learning objective. How can it be improved? Reflection activity 2 (15 mins): What are three kinds of learning activities that you find most effective as a learner? In breakout groups, discuss. Materials to Prepare Presentation on creating good learning objectives and what makes them good. Activities: Have a list of good and bad learning objectives to compare. Activities: Facilitate how to match learning objectives to learning activities. Instructor Notes Presentation 1: Creating learning objectives \u2013 Introduce the concept of learning objectives \u2013 what is the overall goal and purpose of the training and which learning goals will help achieve this. When developing learning objectives, keep in mind that they should be measurable, can be assessed and are realistic to achieve in the time of the training. There are various tools to help create learning objectives. The instructor can introduce these (e.g. Blooms Taxonomy \u2013 Resource 1, other guides that the instructor prefers). Introduce what learning activities are and how they help deliver the content and help to meet the learning objectives. Learning activities can have different purposes. The instructor can introduce different approaches as well as how different learning activities can be used for different levels of learning (Example: Fair by Design Methodology Resource 2, 3). Reflection Activity 1: The instructor should introduce a few learning objectives (good and poor) and then provide these examples to the learners for discussion. At the end of the discussion, learners should know the key elements of a good learning objective. Reflection Activity 2: The goal of this activity is to introduce various learning activities and discuss how the learner is being engaged, for instance, video, case study, discussion, and so on. The trainer could also use learning activities from this training to use as an example (Resource 3). The trainer can introduce ice breakers that can be embedded into the training (Resource 4).

Learning Objective 3 LO3: Plan how to gather feedback for further improvement in lesson development Learning Activities Presentation (15 mins): Introduction to strategies on feedback collection from learners and how this can be used to improve training. Why is feedback collection important? What are some ways to collect feedback during or after a training? Discussion (15 mins): Ask learners to discuss how they would design and collect feedback for this current training. To take the discussion further, the instructor can also ask learners to think about how the feedback gathered could possibly change the way future trainings are conducted. Materials to Prepare Presentation on importance of feedback and collection methods. Discussion: Facilitate a discussion on how to incorporate feedback for improvement. Instructor Notes Presentation: Highlight the importance of collecting feedback for continuous improvement of training. The instructor can use the resource to explain different strategies to collect feedback (Resource 1).

Learning Objective 4 LO4: Identify context-specific resources for training and use these to design learning activities Learning Activities Activity 1 (15 mins): Ask participants to pick a topic such as training on Data Management Plans, Data Management Policies and ask them to list possible resources that they would identify and use as part of learning activities that are relevant to their country or institutional context. Activity 2 (15 mins): Using context and/or discipline specific resources, participants are asked to design a learning activity for a training. This can be done in groups where there are similar interests/contexts/disciplines. The activity should support specific learning activities that should be identified. Materials to Prepare List some sample resources for some topics such as Data Management Plan, Data management Policies as examples. Collect some sample discipline specific resources to use as examples. Instructor Notes Context and/or discipline specific resources: Resources can complement learning activities and be used to make the training more specific. The group exercises and activities help to identify context specific examples so that the resources used during trainings are relevant. The trainer can highlight that materials can be reused during trainings or and more Open Educational Resources (OER) can be found through Zenodo or other institutional OER sites. Some examples of activities can be used as inspiration (Resource 1).
