Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Describe the basic principles of file management. Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Set up a file structure for data files. Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Identify and distinguish between open and closed file formats. Learning Objective 4 (LO4): Explain the benefits and disadvantages of Open and closed file formats and. Learning Objective 5 (LO5): Explain the concept of obsolescence and identify factors that can contribute to obsolescence and how to mitigate them. Total Module Duration 9 \u2013 9.5 hours (including preparatory exercises) Learning Objective 1 LO1: Describe the basic principles of file management. Learning Activities Pre-reading (45 mins): Before the lesson ask the learners to watch a short video about organising files and data (Resource 1) and read this webpage about file naming conventions (Resource 2). Lecture (120 mins): Introduce the basics of file management, building on the Carpentries lesson in File management (Resource 3). (Optional) Supplementary activity (120 mins): Follow the Library Carpentry lesson on Tidy Data (Resource 4) either as an in-class activity or self-paced option. Materials to Prepare Distribute the pre-reading and video prior to the session. Lecture on basis of file management and its importance. Optional activity \u2013 introduce and facilitate the carpentries lesson on Tidy data as a code along or self-paced activity or digital learning environment. Instructor Notes Lecture: Give an introduction to the basics of file management (paths, trees and folders and naming conventions) to give an overview of why file management is important for data security, efficiency and collaboration. Introduce concepts and terminology, such as hierarchical, network and relational systems; file management tools such as organisational, search functions, version control, access management, collaboration and integration. Key takeaways to cover include: Every computer has a file system used to keep track of the files on that machine. This system varies according to the computer. However, there is a common aim: The operational system (OS) allows the user to organize the contents of their computer in a hierarchical structure of directories that includes drives, folders, subfolders, and files. File organization means the information/documents are organized so that a computer can read and understand it. This lets you use the full power of the computer for your analyses and stewardship. Even though files are neatly organized, the content still might have errors or missing data or other problems. It's like you put all your data in the right drawers, but the drawers might still be messy. Optional Activity: This activity follows the library carpentry lesson on file management. The Carpentry lessons include instructor notes and exercises and can be taught as \"code-along\" or self-paced activities. An optional hands-on activity is the Carpentry lesson about the Tidy Data principles. The Tidy Data activity would add another 120 mins to the lesson.

Learning Objective 2 LO2: Set up a file structure for data files. Learning Activities Presentation (20 mins): Presentation to the practicalities of file-naming and version control. Reflection activity (45 mins): This activity is on the advantages and disadvantages the instructor and learners have experienced when storing files locally on their own computer and in a cloud solution (e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive). The learners are encouraged to share in small groups how files on their computer are organised and assess & give feedback to each other on how they have named the files and worked with version control (as covered in LO1). After the reflection activity, the learners can conduct an independent reflection to write a file naming convention using a project or files the learner has in their path finder. They formulate the naming convention and best practices for a fictive research group working with these files. Materials to Prepare Presentation on practicalities of file management and version control. Reflection activity: The instructor might have to bring their own examples and facilitate learns to share their own examples. Instructor Notes Presentation: The instructor can provide practical instruction in and discussion on approaches to structuring and naming. Tips can be provided on creating a file naming convention that suits the discipline and data format requirements in research projects so that project members can navigate the data files. Allow time for your learners to create a file naming convention and structure and give feedback to someone else's work. Key take-aways: The topics covered provide an introduction to the best ways of saving datafiles so they are not lost. There can be disciplinary and project-level differences in file naming and organisation. A slide deck on the practicalities of file management and version control (Resource 1). The instructor can cover information on sorting files, what is good information for file naming, and how to do version control. Sample first slide The presentation can be kicked off by the following two questions: Which filename is the most appropriate of the three below and why? 2022-03-24_Attachment 24 marts 2022 Attachment 24032022attachment Which file names is the most appropriate of the three below and why? labtox_recent_110810_old_version.sps 2010-08-11_bioasssay_tox_V1.sps FFTX_3776438656.sps Detailed key points to cover in the presentation Sorting files: Computers often sort files alphabetically in the file browser. It is therefore a good idea to place the key information at the beginning of the file name. However, the sorting can be changed, e.g. to use the date the file was saved. Sorting by date: If you think you will need to find files by date, place the date the data were created at the start of the file name. The best date format is YYYYMMDDhhmm , as this ensures the files are sorted by year, then month, day and time. Use 24-hour format to avoid confusion about am/pm. When you use the date as the first element, the computer will be able to sort the files in correct chronological order, with either the newest or oldest first. What information is good to include in the file name? Think about what other information is good to include in the file name. For example, the initials of the person who conducted the experiment, performed the interview or collected the information in some other way. You might then add the experiment or interview number, if the data are collected in a specific order. Finally, you might add an abbreviation for the project or assignment. If you create a folder for data solely for a specific project, it might seem unnecessary to include the project name or abbreviation in the file name, but it may still be a good idea, as you might send a file to someone who has a different folder structure. In this case, it is good that they can see which project the file belongs to. Also, file names should be kept short. Try to limit them to 25-30 characters. Elements that can be included in file names are: The date the file was created Location (where the data were collected) Project name or number Sample number Name of analysis or abbreviation Version number Name (or an abbreviation) of the person who collected the data, conducted the experiment or last worked on the file. File names must be readable, without compromising on precision. Some software does not like spaces in file names, so you should avoid them. You can replace spaces with - (hyphen) or _ (underscore). Or you can start new words with a capital letter. For example: file-name.xxx file_name.xxx FileName.xxx Where 'xxx' is the file extension, showing the file type (e.g. .txt, .doc, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx). Avoid special characters such as: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; : < > ? . , [ ] { } ' \" | DO NOT WRITE FILE NAMES ALL IN UPPER-CASE. IT MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO READ. Examples of good file names: 20190102_ac_smithlab_utra_exp01_gel_003.tiff date_experimentNumber_content_version.fileType: 20190501_exp123_analysis_v01.pdf date_analysisMethod_topic_version.fileType: 20190811_bioassay_toxicity_V1.sps date_journalName_documentName_versionNumber.fileType: 2020-plos-manuscript-v26.pdf Examples of bad file names: Test data 2016.xlsx Meeting notes Jan 17.doc Notes Eric.txt Final FINAL last version.docx Sorting based on types of files and content: If you work with different types of files or data from different sources, equipment or experiments, it is best to store them in separate folders. For example, you could store microscopy images in one folder, questionnaire responses in a second folder and audio files from interviews in a third. When naming your folders, it is important not to use the same subfolder names for different projects. If you send a subfolder containing files to another person, it could be unclear which project the folder belongs to, so include the project name or abbreviation in the name of subfolders. Versions: If you regularly add more data, it might be good to add a version identifier like 'v2' to the file name, e.g. filename_v2.xxx. If you include numbers in the file name, use leading 0s to ensure the files sort correctly (001, 002, 003). If you have a number of files with the following file names: 1, 246, 3, 111, 22, 33 and 2, older systems might sort them as follows: 1, 111, 2, 22, 246, 3, 33. Naming conventions: It is always a good idea to check whether particular naming conventions are used in your subject area. A naming convention is a standardised way of naming files. This is particularly relevant if you expect to share data publicly. If the data are to be kept private, you can name them in whatever way works best for you. Examples of naming conventions: [initials]_[method]_[topic]_[YYYYMMDD]_[version].[xxx] [project#]_[method]_[version]_[YYYYMMDD].[xxx] [fileType]_[initials]_[date].[xxx] Reflection Activity: Prepare instructions to the reflection activity. Include a case to exemplify file organisation and a codex for versioning. Prepare a checklist for file-naming using the information below developed by Copenhagen University working group for Digital Competences (Resource 3).

Learning Objective 3 LO3: Identify and distinguish between open and closed file formats. Learning Activities Lecture (45 \u2013 60 mins): on file formats, durability and recommended formats. Q&A : The walking questions (Resource 2) can be used for this activity between learners about image formats, formats that are best suited for short and medium term storage, file formats best suited for long term preservation and why use non-proprietary/open formats. The instructor can use Resource 1 where it discusses formats to facilitate the discussion. Materials to Prepare Lecture/slide deck on open and closed file formats and considerations to use each. Question prompts to facilitate the activity around file formats (Resource 1, 2). Instructor Notes Consider letting the learners read or watch selected materials from the resource list before the lesson to encourage questions during the lecture. Pose questions and to and between the learners to discuss during the lecture. Lecture: What are open and closed file formats? What are durable file formats? When would you use an open file format and when would you used a closed file format? What could the consequences of using a closed format be for Open Science? Key takeaways: Selecting the right file format depends on the purpose, need for accessibility, and long-term preservation goals. Adhering to disciplinary standards and recommended practices ensures compliance and enhances the integrity and usability of digital data. While Open file formats promote accessibility, interoperability, and long-term preservation, closed file formats can include robust security features, controlled by the owning company or have features that simply do not exist in open formats. However closed file formats can hinder data sharing and access, posing risks to the sustainability of digital information. Different file formats offer varying levels of security and privacy protection. Q&A: This activity helps learners to think and provide their own answers to questions they may have. The instructor facilitates this by having prompts ready as well as the answers ready for discussion (Resource 1, 2).

Learning Objective 4 LO4: Explain the benefits and disadvantages of Open and closed file formats. Learning Activities Introduction (20 mins): Introduction to the topic and the workshop and aligning expectations to learners 'participation. Case Study (60 mins): Case study where the learners suggest file formats for a fictional PI and research project. The aim is to get the learners to weigh the benefits and disadvantages of different formats in the context of the research field's traditions and requirements. Consequently, they will have to argue for and against open/closed format considering factors such as accessibility, longevity and data integrity. Resource 1-3 can be shared with learners to refer to during this activity. Materials to Prepare An introduction to the workshop which will be on the benefits and downsides of open and closed file formats through a case study. Present a fictitious case study as suggested in the instructor notes (or a real one if the instructor can present something from their own experience). Instructor Notes Introduction: Prepare a slide deck outlining the activity which will take the whole lesson and what you expect the learners to do. Prepare a list of recommended resources the learners can refer to during the case work. Case study: Prepare/present the fictive case study below: A Principle Investigator contacts the data steward (the learners) and requests help designing a file organisation to appropriately structure the project files and choosing appropriate file formats for the data, with preservation in mind. Find the metadata describing an open project in a repository relevant for the discipline or disciplines of the learners. Ensure the type or types of data collected in the project is described, the sources of the data, possible technical limitations, software to be used in analyses, and other relevant external data and information. Of course the instructor may have to manipulate the metadata, removing or adding information so the learners can come with ideas about which file organisation and formats they would suggest. Discussion points can be prepared (e.g. on a digital discussion board) where discussion is facilitated so the learners respond to different prompts in their thought processes: Which format best ensures long-term preservation and accessibility? What are the trade-offs between advanced features in closed formats and the accessibility of open formats? How do ethical and legal considerations influence the choice of file format?

Learning Activities Exercise (45 mins): Learners will convert a provided file from a closed format (e.g., .docx) to various open formats (e.g., .pdf, .txt, .csv). They will note any data loss during conversion (e.g., formatting, embedded images, metadata) and prepare any questions they have about why certain data might not be preserved in the new format (Resource 1). Lecture (45 mins): Lecture about obsolescence, preservation and working open and FAIR. (Optional) Module Assessment (45 mins): Gage comprehension of LO1 \u2013 LO5. Materials to Prepare Providing a closed format file to learners. Slide deck on the implications of obsolescence and benefits of using open formats. Optional Module Assessment through the use of a real life case study or suggested examples given in the Instructor Notes. Instructor Notes Exercise: The instructor provides learners with a closed format file and request that they convert from a closed format (e.g., .docx) to various open formats (e.g., .pdf, .txt, .csv). Ask learners to: Note any data loss during conversion (e.g., formatting, embedded images, metadata) Prepare any questions they have about why certain data might not be preserved in the new format. The instructor can end the exercise by summarising points raised from the questions above and discuss strategies for mitigating data loss in the conversion process. Slide deck: Prepare a slide deck using the materials about the implications of obsolescence (Resources 2,3) and the benefits of using open formats (Resource 4,5) and (optionally) in line with FAIR, and OPEN principles. Points to present to and discuss with the learners during the presentation can be: Data Integrity: How does the conversion process affect data integrity and usability? Data ethics: Which considerations did you have about security, privacy and ethical/legal issues? Long-Term Access: What measures can be taken to ensure long-term access and prevent obsolescence? Preservation: Which strategies could be recommended to mitigate obsolescence? Ethical Considerations: How do open formats align with ethical standards in their specific research field? Help the learners assess the security and privacy of converted files. Consider how easily the data can be accessed, modified, or shared without authorization. Discuss the usability of the files in different formats after conversion. Consider aspects like ease of access, readability, and whether the essential data remains intact and functional. Identify challenges such as corrupted data, loss of functionality (e.g., formulas in spreadsheets), or incompatibility with commonly used software. (Optional) Module Assessment Prepare an assessment activity to gage the learners comprehension of LO1 \u2013 LO5. The instructor presents a research project they know well (such as one of their own) OR uses one of the project example below (Example 1, Example 2). Ensure the project description contains information about the type of data collected (e.g., qualitative interviews, quantitative measurements, images), software and file formats initially used, potential collaborators and stakeholders, ethical considerations and privacy issues and requirements for long-term preservation. How to conduct the activity: Divide students into small groups where the learners take on the role of a data steward and have to advise on the following aspects of the project: Create a file organisation plan and a naming convention. Selection of appropriate file formats (open vs. closed) and rationale for the choice. Steps for converting closed formats to open formats. Considerations of application of the FAIR principles (refer to the unit on FAIR data). Strategies to mitigate obsolescence and ensure long-term preservation. Consideration of security, privacy, and ethical issues. Groups will document their plan and prepare a brief presentation. Each group presents their plan. Class discussion and feedback on how to improve the plans. Conclusion and Reflection. Example 1: Health and Lifestyle Survey Description: A survey dataset collected from participants about their health and lifestyle habits, intended for research on public health trends. Format: SPSS files Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier for each participant (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 35, 42, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Location: City or region of residence (e.g., New York, London, Berlin) Health Information: Chronic Conditions: Information on chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes,hypertension) Medication: List of medications taken (e.g., insulin, antihypertensives) Medical History: Any significant medical history (e.g., surgeries, hospitalisations) Lifestyle Information: Diet: Information about dietary habits (e.g., vegetarian, high-protein diet) Exercise: Frequency and type of exercise (e.g., daily jogging, weekly gym sessions) Sleep Patterns: Average hours of sleep per night (e.g., 6 hours, 8 hours) Survey Responses: Self-Rated Health: Participant's self-assessment of their health (e.g., Excellent,Good, Fair, Poor) Health Goals: Personal health goals and aspirations (e.g., lose weight, managestress) Barriers to Health: Challenges faced in maintaining a healthy lifestyle (e.g., lack of time, financial constraints) Data Sensitivity Considerations: Sensitive Data: o Personal Information: Location, gender, and age may be sensitive when combined with other data. o Health Information: Chronic conditions and medication details are highly sensitive and should be handled with care. Non-Sensitive Data: Diet and Exercise Information: While still valuable, these data points are less sensitive compared to detailed health information. Example 2: Handling Sensitive Data for a Mental Health and Wellbeing Study Description: A research study aiming to explore the relationship between mental health and various lifestyle factors. The study collected detailed interview responses from participants on mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences. Format: Interviews in MAC pages format Coded interviews in an NVivo project format Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 28, 45, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Mental Health Information: Symptoms: Self-reported symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) Treatment History: Details of mental health treatments (e.g., therapy sessions, medications) Personal Experiences: Descriptions of significant life events impacting mental health Lifestyle Factors: Social Support: Information on social support networks (e.g., friends, family) Work-Life Balance: Participant's perception of their work-life balance (e.g., stress levels, job satisfaction) You are responsible for preparing this dataset for sharing with other researchers to facilitate further analysis while ensuring that sensitive information is adequately protected. Challenges: Sensitive Data: Mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences are highly sensitive and must be handled with strict confidentiality. Balancing Openness: The study aims to share valuable insights while protecting participant privacy. Solutions: Anonymisation: Remove Identifiers: Strip out or anonymise personal identifiers such as Participant ID and specific age or gender details. Aggregate Data: Aggregate symptoms and treatment history into broader categories to minimise the risk of identification (e.g., generalising symptom categories instead of detailed descriptions). For the instructor the goal of this optional activity is that the learner think about the importance of file organization and choosing the right file formats as well as the broader implications of their choices in the context of open science and digital preservation.Give more time than you think for the case work and discussion afterwards, as there are many issues that can be discussed! Key Take-aways: File management is the organization, structure, naming, accessing, and storing of documents. Good file management increases efficiency as information is easily found and understood. Specific consequences of file mismanagement vary depending on the project; however, general risks include legal liability, regulatory non-compliance, duplication of efforts, misunderstanding of data, loss of knowledge during turnover, file obsolescence or corruption, inability to verify information, unclear provenance, and wasted time finding or accessing information. Choosing the right file format is important. The benefits of Open File Formats are increased accessibility, interoperability, longevity and transparency. The disadvantages can be limited features and less technical support. Benefits of Closed File Formats are the have sophisticated features and functionalities, integrate with other proprietary software's, there is good support. Disadvantages are restricted access, limited compatibility, risk of obsolescence and cost. Effective preservation often requires specialized technical knowledge, which may be lacking in some organizations. Over time, data stored in certain formats can degrade, leading to loss of information and reduced usability. Compatibility Issues: As new software and systems emerge, older formats may become incompatible, making data retrieval difficult. Data Sensitivity: Consider privacy and security implications, particularly for sensitive or confidential data. Licensing: Be aware of any licensing restrictions that might affect the use and distribution of the chosen format. Consider who needs to access the data and ensure the format chosen facilitates broad accessibility and collaboration.

Introduce concepts and terminology, such as hierarchical, network and relational systems; file management tools such as organisational, search functions, version control, access management, collaboration and integration. Key takeaways to cover include: Every computer has a file system used to keep track of the files on that machine. This system varies according to the computer. However, there is a common aim: The operational system (OS) allows the user to organize the contents of their computer in a hierarchical structure of directories that includes drives, folders, subfolders, and files. File organization means the information/documents are organized so that a computer can read and understand it. This lets you use the full power of the computer for your analyses and stewardship. Even though files are neatly organized, the content still might have errors or missing data or other problems. It's like you put all your data in the right drawers, but the drawers might still be messy. Optional Activity: This activity follows the library carpentry lesson on file management. The Carpentry lessons include instructor notes and exercises and can be taught as \"code-along\" or self-paced activities. An optional hands-on activity is the Carpentry lesson about the Tidy Data principles.

Key take-aways: The topics covered provide an introduction to the best ways of saving datafiles so they are not lost. There can be disciplinary and project-level differences in file naming and organisation. A slide deck on the practicalities of file management and version control (Resource 1). The instructor can cover information on sorting files, what is good information for file naming, and how to do version control. Sample first slide The presentation can be kicked off by the following two questions: Which filename is the most appropriate of the three below and why? 2022-03-24_Attachment 24 marts 2022 Attachment 24032022attachment Which file names is the most appropriate of the three below and why? labtox_recent_110810_old_version.sps 2010-08-11_bioasssay_tox_V1.sps FFTX_3776438656.sps Detailed key points to cover in the presentation Sorting files: Computers often sort files alphabetically in the file browser. It is therefore a good idea to place the key information at the beginning of the file name. However, the sorting can be changed, e.g. to use the date the file was saved. Sorting by date: If you think you will need to find files by date, place the date the data were created at the start of the file name. The best date format is YYYYMMDDhhmm , as this ensures the files are sorted by year, then month, day and time. Use 24-hour format to avoid confusion about am/pm. When you use the date as the first element, the computer will be able to sort the files in correct chronological order, with either the newest or oldest first. What information is good to include in the file name? Think about what other information is good to include in the file name. For example, the initials of the person who conducted the experiment, performed the interview or collected the information in some other way. You might then add the experiment or interview number, if the data are collected in a specific order. Finally, you might add an abbreviation for the project or assignment. If you create a folder for data solely for a specific project, it might seem unnecessary to include the project name or abbreviation in the file name, but it may still be a good idea, as you might send a file to someone who has a different folder structure. In this case, it is good that they can see which project the file belongs to. Also, file names should be kept short. Try to limit them to 25-30 characters. Elements that can be included in file names are: The date the file was created Location (where the data were collected) Project name or number Sample number Name of analysis or abbreviation Version number Name (or an abbreviation) of the person who collected the data, conducted the experiment or last worked on the file. File names must be readable, without compromising on precision. Some software does not like spaces in file names, so you should avoid them. You can replace spaces with - (hyphen) or _ (underscore). Or you can start new words with a capital letter. For example: file-name.xxx file_name.xxx FileName.xxx Where 'xxx' is the file extension, showing the file type (e.g. .txt, .doc, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx). Avoid special characters such as: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; : < > ? . , [ ] { } ' \" | DO NOT WRITE FILE NAMES ALL IN UPPER-CASE. IT MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO READ. Examples of good file names: 20190102_ac_smithlab_utra_exp01_gel_003.tiff date_experimentNumber_content_version.fileType: 20190501_exp123_analysis_v01.pdf date_analysisMethod_topic_version.fileType: 20190811_bioassay_toxicity_V1.sps date_journalName_documentName_versionNumber.fileType: 2020-plos-manuscript-v26.pdf Examples of bad file names: Test data 2016.xlsx Meeting notes Jan 17.doc Notes Eric.txt Final FINAL last version.docx Sorting based on types of files and content: If you work with different types of files or data from different sources, equipment or experiments, it is best to store them in separate folders. For example, you could store microscopy images in one folder, questionnaire responses in a second folder and audio files from interviews in a third. When naming your folders, it is important not to use the same subfolder names for different projects. If you send a subfolder containing files to another person, it could be unclear which project the folder belongs to, so include the project name or abbreviation in the name of subfolders. Versions: If you regularly add more data, it might be good to add a version identifier like 'v2' to the file name, e.g. filename_v2.xxx. If you include numbers in the file name, use leading 0s to ensure the files sort correctly (001, 002, 003). If you have a number of files with the following file names: 1, 246, 3, 111, 22, 33 and 2, older systems might sort them as follows: 1, 111, 2, 22, 246, 3, 33. Naming conventions: It is always a good idea to check whether particular naming conventions are used in your subject area. A naming convention is a standardised way of naming files. This is particularly relevant if you expect to share data publicly. If the data are to be kept private, you can name them in whatever way works best for you. Examples of naming conventions: [initials]_[method]_[topic]_[YYYYMMDD]_[version].[xxx] [project#]_[method]_[version]_[YYYYMMDD].[xxx] [fileType]_[initials]_[date].[xxx] Reflection Activity: Prepare instructions to the reflection activity. Include a case to exemplify file organisation and a codex for versioning. Prepare a checklist for file-naming using the information below developed by Copenhagen University working group for Digital Competences (Resource 3).","title":"Instructor Notes"},{"location":"1%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Format/#resources_1","text":"Input for the presentation \u2013 for instructors: Kjorveziroski, V. and Buss, M.

Example 1: Health and Lifestyle Survey Description: A survey dataset collected from participants about their health and lifestyle habits, intended for research on public health trends. Format: SPSS files Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier for each participant (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 35, 42, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Location: City or region of residence (e.g., New York, London, Berlin) Health Information: Chronic Conditions: Information on chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes,hypertension) Medication: List of medications taken (e.g., insulin, antihypertensives) Medical History: Any significant medical history (e.g., surgeries, hospitalisations) Lifestyle Information: Diet: Information about dietary habits (e.g., vegetarian, high-protein diet) Exercise: Frequency and type of exercise (e.g., daily jogging, weekly gym sessions) Sleep Patterns: Average hours of sleep per night (e.g., 6 hours, 8 hours) Survey Responses: Self-Rated Health: Participant's self-assessment of their health (e.g., Excellent,Good, Fair, Poor) Health Goals: Personal health goals and aspirations (e.g., lose weight, managestress) Barriers to Health: Challenges faced in maintaining a healthy lifestyle (e.g., lack of time, financial constraints) Data Sensitivity Considerations: Sensitive Data: o Personal Information: Location, gender, and age may be sensitive when combined with other data. o Health Information: Chronic conditions and medication details are highly sensitive and should be handled with care. Non-Sensitive Data: Diet and Exercise Information: While still valuable, these data points are less sensitive compared to detailed health information. Example 2: Handling Sensitive Data for a Mental Health and Wellbeing Study Description: A research study aiming to explore the relationship between mental health and various lifestyle factors. The study collected detailed interview responses from participants on mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences. Format: Interviews in MAC pages format Coded interviews in an NVivo project format Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 28, 45, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Mental Health Information: Symptoms: Self-reported symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) Treatment History: Details of mental health treatments (e.g., therapy sessions, medications) Personal Experiences: Descriptions of significant life events impacting mental health Lifestyle Factors: Social Support: Information on social support networks (e.g., friends, family) Work-Life Balance: Participant's perception of their work-life balance (e.g., stress levels, job satisfaction) You are responsible for preparing this dataset for sharing with other researchers to facilitate further analysis while ensuring that sensitive information is adequately protected. Challenges: Sensitive Data: Mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences are highly sensitive and must be handled with strict confidentiality. Balancing Openness: The study aims to share valuable insights while protecting participant privacy. Solutions: Anonymisation: Remove Identifiers: Strip out or anonymise personal identifiers such as Participant ID and specific age or gender details. Aggregate Data: Aggregate symptoms and treatment history into broader categories to minimise the risk of identification (e.g., generalising symptom categories instead of detailed descriptions). For the instructor the goal of this optional activity is that the learner think about the importance of file organization and choosing the right file formats as well as the broader implications of their choices in the context of open science and digital preservation.Give more time than you think for the case work and discussion afterwards, as there are many issues that can be discussed! Key Take-aways: File management is the organization, structure, naming, accessing, and storing of documents. Good file management increases efficiency as information is easily found and understood. Specific consequences of file mismanagement vary depending on the project; however, general risks include legal liability, regulatory non-compliance, duplication of efforts, misunderstanding of data, loss of knowledge during turnover, file obsolescence or corruption, inability to verify information, unclear provenance, and wasted time finding or accessing information. Choosing the right file format is important. The benefits of Open File Formats are increased accessibility, interoperability, longevity and transparency. The disadvantages can be limited features and less technical support. Benefits of Closed File Formats are the have sophisticated features and functionalities, integrate with other proprietary software's, there is good support. Disadvantages are restricted access, limited compatibility, risk of obsolescence and cost. Effective preservation often requires specialized technical knowledge, which may be lacking in some organizations. Over time, data stored in certain formats can degrade, leading to loss of information and reduced usability. Compatibility Issues: As new software and systems emerge, older formats may become incompatible, making data retrieval difficult. Data Sensitivity: Consider privacy and security implications, particularly for sensitive or confidential data. Licensing: Be aware of any licensing restrictions that might affect the use and distribution of the chosen format. Consider who needs to access the data and ensure the format chosen facilitates broad accessibility and collaboration.","title":"Instructor Notes"},{"location":"1%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Format/#resources_4","text":"Input for file conversion exercise \u2013 resources for the instructor: Converting from One File Type to Another | Computing . https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/converting-one-file-type-another .

Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Describe the basic principles of file management. Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Set up a file structure for data files. Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Identify and distinguish between open and closed file formats. Learning Objective 4 (LO4): Explain the benefits and disadvantages of Open and closed file formats and. Learning Objective 5 (LO5): Explain the concept of obsolescence and identify factors that can contribute to obsolescence and how to mitigate them. Total Module Duration 9 \u2013 9.5 hours (including preparatory exercises) Learning Objective 1 LO1: Describe the basic principles of file management. Learning Activities Pre-reading (45 mins): Before the lesson ask the learners to watch a short video about organising files and data (Resource 1) and read this webpage about file naming conventions (Resource 2). Lecture (120 mins): Introduce the basics of file management, building on the Carpentries lesson in File management (Resource 3). (Optional) Supplementary activity (120 mins): Follow the Library Carpentry lesson on Tidy Data (Resource 4) either as an in-class activity or self-paced option. Materials to Prepare Distribute the pre-reading and video prior to the session. Lecture on basis of file management and its importance. Optional activity \u2013 introduce and facilitate the carpentries lesson on Tidy data as a code along or self-paced activity or digital learning environment. Instructor Notes Lecture: Give an introduction to the basics of file management (paths, trees and folders and naming conventions) to give an overview of why file management is important for data security, efficiency and collaboration. Introduce concepts and terminology, such as hierarchical, network and relational systems; file management tools such as organisational, search functions, version control, access management, collaboration and integration. Key takeaways to cover include: Every computer has a file system used to keep track of the files on that machine. This system varies according to the computer. However, there is a common aim: The operational system (OS) allows the user to organize the contents of their computer in a hierarchical structure of directories that includes drives, folders, subfolders, and files. File organization means the information/documents are organized so that a computer can read and understand it. This lets you use the full power of the computer for your analyses and stewardship. Even though files are neatly organized, the content still might have errors or missing data or other problems. It's like you put all your data in the right drawers, but the drawers might still be messy. Optional Activity: This activity follows the library carpentry lesson on file management. The Carpentry lessons include instructor notes and exercises and can be taught as \"code-along\" or self-paced activities. An optional hands-on activity is the Carpentry lesson about the Tidy Data principles. The Tidy Data activity would add another 120 mins to the lesson.

Learning Objective 2 LO2: Set up a file structure for data files. Learning Activities Presentation (20 mins): Presentation to the practicalities of file-naming and version control. Reflection activity (45 mins): This activity is on the advantages and disadvantages the instructor and learners have experienced when storing files locally on their own computer and in a cloud solution (e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive). The learners are encouraged to share in small groups how files on their computer are organised and assess & give feedback to each other on how they have named the files and worked with version control (as covered in LO1). After the reflection activity, the learners can conduct an independent reflection to write a file naming convention using a project or files the learner has in their path finder. They formulate the naming convention and best practices for a fictive research group working with these files. Materials to Prepare Presentation on practicalities of file management and version control. Reflection activity: The instructor might have to bring their own examples and facilitate learns to share their own examples. Instructor Notes Presentation: The instructor can provide practical instruction in and discussion on approaches to structuring and naming. Tips can be provided on creating a file naming convention that suits the discipline and data format requirements in research projects so that project members can navigate the data files. Allow time for your learners to create a file naming convention and structure and give feedback to someone else's work. Key take-aways: The topics covered provide an introduction to the best ways of saving datafiles so they are not lost. There can be disciplinary and project-level differences in file naming and organisation. A slide deck on the practicalities of file management and version control (Resource 1). The instructor can cover information on sorting files, what is good information for file naming, and how to do version control. Sample first slide The presentation can be kicked off by the following two questions: Which filename is the most appropriate of the three below and why? 2022-03-24_Attachment 24 marts 2022 Attachment 24032022attachment Which file names is the most appropriate of the three below and why? labtox_recent_110810_old_version.sps 2010-08-11_bioasssay_tox_V1.sps FFTX_3776438656.sps Detailed key points to cover in the presentation Sorting files: Computers often sort files alphabetically in the file browser. It is therefore a good idea to place the key information at the beginning of the file name. However, the sorting can be changed, e.g. to use the date the file was saved. Sorting by date: If you think you will need to find files by date, place the date the data were created at the start of the file name. The best date format is YYYYMMDDhhmm , as this ensures the files are sorted by year, then month, day and time. Use 24-hour format to avoid confusion about am/pm. When you use the date as the first element, the computer will be able to sort the files in correct chronological order, with either the newest or oldest first. What information is good to include in the file name? Think about what other information is good to include in the file name. For example, the initials of the person who conducted the experiment, performed the interview or collected the information in some other way. You might then add the experiment or interview number, if the data are collected in a specific order. Finally, you might add an abbreviation for the project or assignment. If you create a folder for data solely for a specific project, it might seem unnecessary to include the project name or abbreviation in the file name, but it may still be a good idea, as you might send a file to someone who has a different folder structure. In this case, it is good that they can see which project the file belongs to. Also, file names should be kept short. Try to limit them to 25-30 characters. Elements that can be included in file names are: The date the file was created Location (where the data were collected) Project name or number Sample number Name of analysis or abbreviation Version number Name (or an abbreviation) of the person who collected the data, conducted the experiment or last worked on the file. File names must be readable, without compromising on precision. Some software does not like spaces in file names, so you should avoid them. You can replace spaces with - (hyphen) or _ (underscore). Or you can start new words with a capital letter. For example: file-name.xxx file_name.xxx FileName.xxx Where 'xxx' is the file extension, showing the file type (e.g. .txt, .doc, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx). Avoid special characters such as: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; : < > ? . , [ ] { } ' \" | DO NOT WRITE FILE NAMES ALL IN UPPER-CASE. IT MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO READ. Examples of good file names: 20190102_ac_smithlab_utra_exp01_gel_003.tiff date_experimentNumber_content_version.fileType: 20190501_exp123_analysis_v01.pdf date_analysisMethod_topic_version.fileType: 20190811_bioassay_toxicity_V1.sps date_journalName_documentName_versionNumber.fileType: 2020-plos-manuscript-v26.pdf Examples of bad file names: Test data 2016.xlsx Meeting notes Jan 17.doc Notes Eric.txt Final FINAL last version.docx Sorting based on types of files and content: If you work with different types of files or data from different sources, equipment or experiments, it is best to store them in separate folders. For example, you could store microscopy images in one folder, questionnaire responses in a second folder and audio files from interviews in a third. When naming your folders, it is important not to use the same subfolder names for different projects. If you send a subfolder containing files to another person, it could be unclear which project the folder belongs to, so include the project name or abbreviation in the name of subfolders. Versions: If you regularly add more data, it might be good to add a version identifier like 'v2' to the file name, e.g. filename_v2.xxx. If you include numbers in the file name, use leading 0s to ensure the files sort correctly (001, 002, 003). If you have a number of files with the following file names: 1, 246, 3, 111, 22, 33 and 2, older systems might sort them as follows: 1, 111, 2, 22, 246, 3, 33. Naming conventions: It is always a good idea to check whether particular naming conventions are used in your subject area. A naming convention is a standardised way of naming files. This is particularly relevant if you expect to share data publicly. If the data are to be kept private, you can name them in whatever way works best for you. Examples of naming conventions: [initials]_[method]_[topic]_[YYYYMMDD]_[version].[xxx] [project#]_[method]_[version]_[YYYYMMDD].[xxx] [fileType]_[initials]_[date].[xxx] Reflection Activity: Prepare instructions to the reflection activity. Include a case to exemplify file organisation and a codex for versioning. Prepare a checklist for file-naming using the information below developed by Copenhagen University working group for Digital Competences (Resource 3).

Learning Objective 3 LO3: Identify and distinguish between open and closed file formats. Learning Activities Lecture (45 \u2013 60 mins): on file formats, durability and recommended formats. Q&A : The walking questions (Resource 2) can be used for this activity between learners about image formats, formats that are best suited for short and medium term storage, file formats best suited for long term preservation and why use non-proprietary/open formats. The instructor can use Resource 1 where it discusses formats to facilitate the discussion. Materials to Prepare Lecture/slide deck on open and closed file formats and considerations to use each. Question prompts to facilitate the activity around file formats (Resource 1, 2). Instructor Notes Consider letting the learners read or watch selected materials from the resource list before the lesson to encourage questions during the lecture. Pose questions and to and between the learners to discuss during the lecture. Lecture: What are open and closed file formats? What are durable file formats? When would you use an open file format and when would you used a closed file format? What could the consequences of using a closed format be for Open Science? Key takeaways: Selecting the right file format depends on the purpose, need for accessibility, and long-term preservation goals. Adhering to disciplinary standards and recommended practices ensures compliance and enhances the integrity and usability of digital data. While Open file formats promote accessibility, interoperability, and long-term preservation, closed file formats can include robust security features, controlled by the owning company or have features that simply do not exist in open formats. However closed file formats can hinder data sharing and access, posing risks to the sustainability of digital information. Different file formats offer varying levels of security and privacy protection. Q&A: This activity helps learners to think and provide their own answers to questions they may have. The instructor facilitates this by having prompts ready as well as the answers ready for discussion (Resource 1, 2).

Learning Objective 4 LO4: Explain the benefits and disadvantages of Open and closed file formats. Learning Activities Introduction (20 mins): Introduction to the topic and the workshop and aligning expectations to learners 'participation. Case Study (60 mins): Case study where the learners suggest file formats for a fictional PI and research project. The aim is to get the learners to weigh the benefits and disadvantages of different formats in the context of the research field's traditions and requirements. Consequently, they will have to argue for and against open/closed format considering factors such as accessibility, longevity and data integrity. Resource 1-3 can be shared with learners to refer to during this activity. Materials to Prepare An introduction to the workshop which will be on the benefits and downsides of open and closed file formats through a case study. Present a fictitious case study as suggested in the instructor notes (or a real one if the instructor can present something from their own experience). Instructor Notes Introduction: Prepare a slide deck outlining the activity which will take the whole lesson and what you expect the learners to do. Prepare a list of recommended resources the learners can refer to during the case work. Case study: Prepare/present the fictive case study below: A Principle Investigator contacts the data steward (the learners) and requests help designing a file organisation to appropriately structure the project files and choosing appropriate file formats for the data, with preservation in mind. Find the metadata describing an open project in a repository relevant for the discipline or disciplines of the learners. Ensure the type or types of data collected in the project is described, the sources of the data, possible technical limitations, software to be used in analyses, and other relevant external data and information. Of course the instructor may have to manipulate the metadata, removing or adding information so the learners can come with ideas about which file organisation and formats they would suggest. Discussion points can be prepared (e.g. on a digital discussion board) where discussion is facilitated so the learners respond to different prompts in their thought processes: Which format best ensures long-term preservation and accessibility? What are the trade-offs between advanced features in closed formats and the accessibility of open formats? How do ethical and legal considerations influence the choice of file format?

Learning Activities Exercise (45 mins): Learners will convert a provided file from a closed format (e.g., .docx) to various open formats (e.g., .pdf, .txt, .csv). They will note any data loss during conversion (e.g., formatting, embedded images, metadata) and prepare any questions they have about why certain data might not be preserved in the new format (Resource 1). Lecture (45 mins): Lecture about obsolescence, preservation and working open and FAIR. (Optional) Module Assessment (45 mins): Gage comprehension of LO1 \u2013 LO5. Materials to Prepare Providing a closed format file to learners. Slide deck on the implications of obsolescence and benefits of using open formats. Optional Module Assessment through the use of a real life case study or suggested examples given in the Instructor Notes. Instructor Notes Exercise: The instructor provides learners with a closed format file and request that they convert from a closed format (e.g., .docx) to various open formats (e.g., .pdf, .txt, .csv). Ask learners to: Note any data loss during conversion (e.g., formatting, embedded images, metadata) Prepare any questions they have about why certain data might not be preserved in the new format. The instructor can end the exercise by summarising points raised from the questions above and discuss strategies for mitigating data loss in the conversion process. Slide deck: Prepare a slide deck using the materials about the implications of obsolescence (Resources 2,3) and the benefits of using open formats (Resource 4,5) and (optionally) in line with FAIR, and OPEN principles. Points to present to and discuss with the learners during the presentation can be: Data Integrity: How does the conversion process affect data integrity and usability? Data ethics: Which considerations did you have about security, privacy and ethical/legal issues? Long-Term Access: What measures can be taken to ensure long-term access and prevent obsolescence? Preservation: Which strategies could be recommended to mitigate obsolescence? Ethical Considerations: How do open formats align with ethical standards in their specific research field? Help the learners assess the security and privacy of converted files. Consider how easily the data can be accessed, modified, or shared without authorization. Discuss the usability of the files in different formats after conversion. Consider aspects like ease of access, readability, and whether the essential data remains intact and functional. Identify challenges such as corrupted data, loss of functionality (e.g., formulas in spreadsheets), or incompatibility with commonly used software. (Optional) Module Assessment Prepare an assessment activity to gage the learners comprehension of LO1 \u2013 LO5. The instructor presents a research project they know well (such as one of their own) OR uses one of the project example below (Example 1, Example 2). Ensure the project description contains information about the type of data collected (e.g., qualitative interviews, quantitative measurements, images), software and file formats initially used, potential collaborators and stakeholders, ethical considerations and privacy issues and requirements for long-term preservation. How to conduct the activity: Divide students into small groups where the learners take on the role of a data steward and have to advise on the following aspects of the project: Create a file organisation plan and a naming convention. Selection of appropriate file formats (open vs. closed) and rationale for the choice. Steps for converting closed formats to open formats. Considerations of application of the FAIR principles (refer to the unit on FAIR data). Strategies to mitigate obsolescence and ensure long-term preservation. Consideration of security, privacy, and ethical issues. Groups will document their plan and prepare a brief presentation. Each group presents their plan. Class discussion and feedback on how to improve the plans. Conclusion and Reflection. Example 1: Health and Lifestyle Survey Description: A survey dataset collected from participants about their health and lifestyle habits, intended for research on public health trends. Format: SPSS files Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier for each participant (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 35, 42, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Location: City or region of residence (e.g., New York, London, Berlin) Health Information: Chronic Conditions: Information on chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes,hypertension) Medication: List of medications taken (e.g., insulin, antihypertensives) Medical History: Any significant medical history (e.g., surgeries, hospitalisations) Lifestyle Information: Diet: Information about dietary habits (e.g., vegetarian, high-protein diet) Exercise: Frequency and type of exercise (e.g., daily jogging, weekly gym sessions) Sleep Patterns: Average hours of sleep per night (e.g., 6 hours, 8 hours) Survey Responses: Self-Rated Health: Participant's self-assessment of their health (e.g., Excellent,Good, Fair, Poor) Health Goals: Personal health goals and aspirations (e.g., lose weight, managestress) Barriers to Health: Challenges faced in maintaining a healthy lifestyle (e.g., lack of time, financial constraints) Data Sensitivity Considerations: Sensitive Data: o Personal Information: Location, gender, and age may be sensitive when combined with other data. o Health Information: Chronic conditions and medication details are highly sensitive and should be handled with care. Non-Sensitive Data: Diet and Exercise Information: While still valuable, these data points are less sensitive compared to detailed health information. Example 2: Handling Sensitive Data for a Mental Health and Wellbeing Study Description: A research study aiming to explore the relationship between mental health and various lifestyle factors. The study collected detailed interview responses from participants on mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences. Format: Interviews in MAC pages format Coded interviews in an NVivo project format Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 28, 45, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Mental Health Information: Symptoms: Self-reported symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) Treatment History: Details of mental health treatments (e.g., therapy sessions, medications) Personal Experiences: Descriptions of significant life events impacting mental health Lifestyle Factors: Social Support: Information on social support networks (e.g., friends, family) Work-Life Balance: Participant's perception of their work-life balance (e.g., stress levels, job satisfaction) You are responsible for preparing this dataset for sharing with other researchers to facilitate further analysis while ensuring that sensitive information is adequately protected. Challenges: Sensitive Data: Mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences are highly sensitive and must be handled with strict confidentiality. Balancing Openness: The study aims to share valuable insights while protecting participant privacy. Solutions: Anonymisation: Remove Identifiers: Strip out or anonymise personal identifiers such as Participant ID and specific age or gender details. Aggregate Data: Aggregate symptoms and treatment history into broader categories to minimise the risk of identification (e.g., generalising symptom categories instead of detailed descriptions). For the instructor the goal of this optional activity is that the learner think about the importance of file organization and choosing the right file formats as well as the broader implications of their choices in the context of open science and digital preservation.Give more time than you think for the case work and discussion afterwards, as there are many issues that can be discussed! Key Take-aways: File management is the organization, structure, naming, accessing, and storing of documents. Good file management increases efficiency as information is easily found and understood. Specific consequences of file mismanagement vary depending on the project; however, general risks include legal liability, regulatory non-compliance, duplication of efforts, misunderstanding of data, loss of knowledge during turnover, file obsolescence or corruption, inability to verify information, unclear provenance, and wasted time finding or accessing information. Choosing the right file format is important. The benefits of Open File Formats are increased accessibility, interoperability, longevity and transparency. The disadvantages can be limited features and less technical support. Benefits of Closed File Formats are the have sophisticated features and functionalities, integrate with other proprietary software's, there is good support. Disadvantages are restricted access, limited compatibility, risk of obsolescence and cost. Effective preservation often requires specialized technical knowledge, which may be lacking in some organizations. Over time, data stored in certain formats can degrade, leading to loss of information and reduced usability. Compatibility Issues: As new software and systems emerge, older formats may become incompatible, making data retrieval difficult. Data Sensitivity: Consider privacy and security implications, particularly for sensitive or confidential data. Licensing: Be aware of any licensing restrictions that might affect the use and distribution of the chosen format. Consider who needs to access the data and ensure the format chosen facilitates broad accessibility and collaboration.

Introduce concepts and terminology, such as hierarchical, network and relational systems; file management tools such as organisational, search functions, version control, access management, collaboration and integration. Key takeaways to cover include: Every computer has a file system used to keep track of the files on that machine. This system varies according to the computer. However, there is a common aim: The operational system (OS) allows the user to organize the contents of their computer in a hierarchical structure of directories that includes drives, folders, subfolders, and files. File organization means the information/documents are organized so that a computer can read and understand it. This lets you use the full power of the computer for your analyses and stewardship. Even though files are neatly organized, the content still might have errors or missing data or other problems. It's like you put all your data in the right drawers, but the drawers might still be messy. Optional Activity: This activity follows the library carpentry lesson on file management. The Carpentry lessons include instructor notes and exercises and can be taught as \"code-along\" or self-paced activities. An optional hands-on activity is the Carpentry lesson about the Tidy Data principles. The Tidy Data activity would add another 120 mins to the lesson.","title":"Instructor Notes"},{"location":"1%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Format_v2/#resources","text":"Resources for learning activities \u2013 instructor and learners: Ghent University. \"RDM Knowledge Clips\" YouTube, Seen 19 March 2025.

Key take-aways: The topics covered provide an introduction to the best ways of saving datafiles so they are not lost. There can be disciplinary and project-level differences in file naming and organisation. A slide deck on the practicalities of file management and version control (Resource 1). The instructor can cover information on sorting files, what is good information for file naming, and how to do version control. Sample first slide The presentation can be kicked off by the following two questions: Which filename is the most appropriate of the three below and why? 2022-03-24_Attachment 24 marts 2022 Attachment 24032022attachment Which file names is the most appropriate of the three below and why? labtox_recent_110810_old_version.sps 2010-08-11_bioasssay_tox_V1.sps FFTX_3776438656.sps Detailed key points to cover in the presentation Sorting files: Computers often sort files alphabetically in the file browser. It is therefore a good idea to place the key information at the beginning of the file name. However, the sorting can be changed, e.g. to use the date the file was saved. Sorting by date: If you think you will need to find files by date, place the date the data were created at the start of the file name. The best date format is YYYYMMDDhhmm , as this ensures the files are sorted by year, then month, day and time. Use 24-hour format to avoid confusion about am/pm. When you use the date as the first element, the computer will be able to sort the files in correct chronological order, with either the newest or oldest first. What information is good to include in the file name? Think about what other information is good to include in the file name. For example, the initials of the person who conducted the experiment, performed the interview or collected the information in some other way. You might then add the experiment or interview number, if the data are collected in a specific order. Finally, you might add an abbreviation for the project or assignment. If you create a folder for data solely for a specific project, it might seem unnecessary to include the project name or abbreviation in the file name, but it may still be a good idea, as you might send a file to someone who has a different folder structure. In this case, it is good that they can see which project the file belongs to. Also, file names should be kept short. Try to limit them to 25-30 characters. Elements that can be included in file names are: The date the file was created Location (where the data were collected) Project name or number Sample number Name of analysis or abbreviation Version number Name (or an abbreviation) of the person who collected the data, conducted the experiment or last worked on the file. File names must be readable, without compromising on precision. Some software does not like spaces in file names, so you should avoid them. You can replace spaces with - (hyphen) or _ (underscore). Or you can start new words with a capital letter. For example: file-name.xxx file_name.xxx FileName.xxx Where 'xxx' is the file extension, showing the file type (e.g. .txt, .doc, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx). Avoid special characters such as: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; : < > ? . , [ ] { } ' \" | DO NOT WRITE FILE NAMES ALL IN UPPER-CASE. IT MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO READ. Examples of good file names: 20190102_ac_smithlab_utra_exp01_gel_003.tiff date_experimentNumber_content_version.fileType: 20190501_exp123_analysis_v01.pdf date_analysisMethod_topic_version.fileType: 20190811_bioassay_toxicity_V1.sps date_journalName_documentName_versionNumber.fileType: 2020-plos-manuscript-v26.pdf Examples of bad file names: Test data 2016.xlsx Meeting notes Jan 17.doc Notes Eric.txt Final FINAL last version.docx Sorting based on types of files and content: If you work with different types of files or data from different sources, equipment or experiments, it is best to store them in separate folders. For example, you could store microscopy images in one folder, questionnaire responses in a second folder and audio files from interviews in a third. When naming your folders, it is important not to use the same subfolder names for different projects. If you send a subfolder containing files to another person, it could be unclear which project the folder belongs to, so include the project name or abbreviation in the name of subfolders. Versions: If you regularly add more data, it might be good to add a version identifier like 'v2' to the file name, e.g. filename_v2.xxx. If you include numbers in the file name, use leading 0s to ensure the files sort correctly (001, 002, 003). If you have a number of files with the following file names: 1, 246, 3, 111, 22, 33 and 2, older systems might sort them as follows: 1, 111, 2, 22, 246, 3, 33. Naming conventions: It is always a good idea to check whether particular naming conventions are used in your subject area. A naming convention is a standardised way of naming files. This is particularly relevant if you expect to share data publicly. If the data are to be kept private, you can name them in whatever way works best for you. Examples of naming conventions: [initials]_[method]_[topic]_[YYYYMMDD]_[version].[xxx] [project#]_[method]_[version]_[YYYYMMDD].[xxx] [fileType]_[initials]_[date].[xxx] Reflection Activity: Prepare instructions to the reflection activity. Include a case to exemplify file organisation and a codex for versioning.

Adhering to disciplinary standards and recommended practices ensures compliance and enhances the integrity and usability of digital data. While Open file formats promote accessibility, interoperability, and long-term preservation, closed file formats can include robust security features, controlled by the owning company or have features that simply do not exist in open formats. However closed file formats can hinder data sharing and access, posing risks to the sustainability of digital information.

Example 1: Health and Lifestyle Survey Description: A survey dataset collected from participants about their health and lifestyle habits, intended for research on public health trends. Format: SPSS files Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier for each participant (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 35, 42, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Location: City or region of residence (e.g., New York, London, Berlin) Health Information: Chronic Conditions: Information on chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes,hypertension) Medication: List of medications taken (e.g., insulin, antihypertensives) Medical History: Any significant medical history (e.g., surgeries, hospitalisations) Lifestyle Information: Diet: Information about dietary habits (e.g., vegetarian, high-protein diet) Exercise: Frequency and type of exercise (e.g., daily jogging, weekly gym sessions) Sleep Patterns: Average hours of sleep per night (e.g., 6 hours, 8 hours) Survey Responses: Self-Rated Health: Participant's self-assessment of their health (e.g., Excellent,Good, Fair, Poor) Health Goals: Personal health goals and aspirations (e.g., lose weight, managestress) Barriers to Health: Challenges faced in maintaining a healthy lifestyle (e.g., lack of time, financial constraints) Data Sensitivity Considerations: Sensitive Data: o Personal Information: Location, gender, and age may be sensitive when combined with other data. o Health Information: Chronic conditions and medication details are highly sensitive and should be handled with care. Non-Sensitive Data: Diet and Exercise Information: While still valuable, these data points are less sensitive compared to detailed health information. Example 2: Handling Sensitive Data for a Mental Health and Wellbeing Study Description: A research study aiming to explore the relationship between mental health and various lifestyle factors. The study collected detailed interview responses from participants on mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences. Format: Interviews in MAC pages format Coded interviews in an NVivo project format Dataset Components: Personal Information: Participant ID: Unique identifier (e.g., P001, P002, ...) Age: Age of the participant (e.g., 28, 45, ...) Gender: Gender of the participant (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) Mental Health Information: Symptoms: Self-reported symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) Treatment History: Details of mental health treatments (e.g., therapy sessions, medications) Personal Experiences: Descriptions of significant life events impacting mental health Lifestyle Factors: Social Support: Information on social support networks (e.g., friends, family) Work-Life Balance: Participant's perception of their work-life balance (e.g., stress levels, job satisfaction) You are responsible for preparing this dataset for sharing with other researchers to facilitate further analysis while ensuring that sensitive information is adequately protected. Challenges: Sensitive Data: Mental health symptoms, treatment history, and personal experiences are highly sensitive and must be handled with strict confidentiality. Balancing Openness: The study aims to share valuable insights while protecting participant privacy. Solutions: Anonymisation: Remove Identifiers: Strip out or anonymise personal identifiers such as Participant ID and specific age or gender details. Aggregate Data: Aggregate symptoms and treatment history into broader categories to minimise the risk of identification (e.g., generalising symptom categories instead of detailed descriptions). For the instructor the goal of this optional activity is that the learner think about the importance of file organization and choosing the right file formats as well as the broader implications of their choices in the context of open science and digital preservation.Give more time than you think for the case work and discussion afterwards, as there are many issues that can be discussed! Key Take-aways: File management is the organization, structure, naming, accessing, and storing of documents. Good file management increases efficiency as information is easily found and understood. Specific consequences of file mismanagement vary depending on the project; however, general risks include legal liability, regulatory non-compliance, duplication of efforts, misunderstanding of data, loss of knowledge during turnover, file obsolescence or corruption, inability to verify information, unclear provenance, and wasted time finding or accessing information. Choosing the right file format is important. The benefits of Open File Formats are increased accessibility, interoperability, longevity and transparency. The disadvantages can be limited features and less technical support. Benefits of Closed File Formats are the have sophisticated features and functionalities, integrate with other proprietary software's, there is good support. Disadvantages are restricted access, limited compatibility, risk of obsolescence and cost. Effective preservation often requires specialized technical knowledge, which may be lacking in some organizations. Over time, data stored in certain formats can degrade, leading to loss of information and reduced usability. Compatibility Issues: As new software and systems emerge, older formats may become incompatible, making data retrieval difficult. Data Sensitivity: Consider privacy and security implications, particularly for sensitive or confidential data. Licensing: Be aware of any licensing restrictions that might affect the use and distribution of the chosen format. Consider who needs to access the data and ensure the format chosen facilitates broad accessibility and collaboration.","title":"Instructor Notes"},{"location":"1%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Format_v2/#resources_4","text":"Input for file conversion exercise \u2013 resources for the instructor: Converting from One File Type to Another | Computing . https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/converting-one-file-type-another .

All materials will be released shortly. Until the official release, please refrain from using, distributing, or implementing any part of these resources. Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Recognise the target audience and their learning needs. Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Design a training for the target audience to meet the learning objectives. Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Plan how to gather feedback for further improvement in lesson development. Learning Objective 4 (LO4): Identify context-specific resources for training and use these to design learning activities. Total Module Duration 3 hours Learning Objective 1 LO1: Recognise the target audience and their learning needs. Learning Activities Presentation/video (15 mins): Start off with an introduction on why a trainer needs to identify their target audience, and how to identify the needs of a target audience. Explain that the trainer should be clear in what they want the target audience to achieve (10 mins). Reflection Activity (30 mins): In breakout groups of 3-4 participants, think about and discuss what possible target audiences Data Stewards might need to train and what training needs they could have. Exercise (15 mins): A hands on exercise to map out the purpose of the training need by identifying the target audience and their possible RDM needs. Use a planning template for this exercise (e.g. the EOSC synergy training template \u2013 Resource 3). Materials to Prepare Presentation on what is a target audience and why to consider their needs when designing a training. Activity and Exercise: Facilitate the learners to think of their context for trainings and consider the target audience and their possible training needs. Instructor Notes Presentation on target audience and learning needs: Once the Data Steward has identified what the problem is and why a training is needed they can design the learning objectives of the training. Then the next step is to identify the target audience. The trainer can highlight the importance of this so that the training can be best designed for that target audience to solve the identified problem together over the course of the training. It is important to assess the target audience's level of expertise. The prior knowledge will determine if a training will start with defining key concepts vs. building upon prior knowledge. As a trainer the data steward should also have to think of how best to deliver a training that meets the learning needs of the target audience (e.g. Think of busy professionals and how this will impact the design of the training). The trainer can develop a presentation using inspiration resources (Resource 1). Reflection Activity: The goal of the reflection activity is to get the learners to start thinking about current knowledge gaps in their institute that they could cover via trainings. Who would the target audience be? The trainer can use the resources to facilitate this activity (Resource 2, 3). You can make the exercise more interesting by asking learners to create a persona for the learners who they will train. Pick a persona and think about what this will mean in terms of training design. Exercise: The trainer can introduce some tools that can be used to identify the target audience and their training needs (Resources 2, 3).

Learning Objective 2 LO2: Design a training for the target audience to meet the learning objectives. Learning Activities Presentation (30 mins): Introduction to creating learning objectives (for instance, using Bloom\\'s Taxonomy), emphasising the importance of using measurable verbs in designing learning objectives. Introduction to some examples of common learning activities and the role that learning activities play in meeting the learning objectives. Reflection activity 1 (15 mins): Instructor presents a learning objective. Evaluate whether this is a clear, measurable learning objective. How can it be improved? Reflection activity 2 (15 mins): What are three kinds of learning activities that you find most effective as a learner? In breakout groups, discuss. Materials to Prepare Presentation on creating good learning objectives and what makes them good. Activities: Have a list of good and bad learning objectives to compare. Activities: Facilitate how to match learning objectives to learning activities. Instructor Notes Presentation 1: Creating learning objectives \u2013 Introduce the concept of learning objectives \u2013 what is the overall goal and purpose of the training and which learning goals will help achieve this. When developing learning objectives, keep in mind that they should be measurable, can be assessed and are realistic to achieve in the time of the training. There are various tools to help create learning objectives. The instructor can introduce these (e.g. Blooms Taxonomy \u2013 Resource 1, other guides that the instructor prefers). Introduce what learning activities are and how they help deliver the content and help to meet the learning objectives. Learning activities can have different purposes. The instructor can introduce different approaches as well as how different learning activities can be used for different levels of learning (Example: Fair by Design Methodology Resource 2, 3). Reflection Activity 1: The instructor should introduce a few learning objectives (good and poor) and then provide these examples to the learners for discussion. At the end of the discussion, learners should know the key elements of a good learning objective. Reflection Activity 2: The goal of this activity is to introduce various learning activities and discuss how the learner is being engaged, for instance, video, case study, discussion, and so on. The trainer could also use learning activities from this training to use as an example (Resource 3). The trainer can introduce ice breakers that can be embedded into the training (Resource 4).

Learning Activities Presentation (15 mins): Introduction to strategies on feedback collection from learners and how this can be used to improve training. Why is feedback collection important? What are some ways to collect feedback during or after a training? Discussion (15 mins): Ask learners to discuss how they would design and collect feedback for this current training. To take the discussion further, the instructor can also ask learners to think about how the feedback gathered could possibly change the way future trainings are conducted. Materials to Prepare Presentation on importance of feedback and collection methods. Discussion: Facilitate a discussion on how to incorporate feedback for improvement. Instructor Notes Presentation: Highlight the importance of collecting feedback for continuous improvement of training. The instructor can use the resource to explain different strategies to collect feedback (Resource 1).

Learning Objective 4 LO4: Identify context-specific resources for training and use these to design learning activities. Learning Activities Activity 1 (15 mins): Ask participants to pick a topic such as training on Data Management Plans, Data Management Policies and ask them to list possible resources that they would identify and use as part of learning activities that are relevant to their country or institutional context. Activity 2 (15 mins): Using context and/or discipline specific resources, participants are asked to design a learning activity for a training. This can be done in groups where there are similar interests/contexts/disciplines. The activity should support specific learning activities that should be identified. Materials to Prepare List some sample resources for some topics such as Data Management Plan, Data management Policies as examples. Collect some sample discipline specific resources to use as examples. Instructor Notes Context and/or discipline specific resources: Resources can complement learning activities and be used to make the training more specific. The group exercises and activities help to identify context specific examples so that the resources used during trainings are relevant. The trainer can highlight that materials can be reused during trainings or and more Open Educational Resources (OER) can be found through Zenodo or other institutional OER sites. Some examples of activities can be used as inspiration (Resource 1).

Then the next step is to identify the target audience. The trainer can highlight the importance of this so that the training can be best designed for that target audience to solve the identified problem together over the course of the training. It is important to assess the target audience's level of expertise. The prior knowledge will determine if a training will start with defining key concepts vs. building upon prior knowledge. As a trainer the data steward should also have to think of how best to deliver a training that meets the learning needs of the target audience (e.g. Think of busy professionals and how this will impact the design of the training). The trainer can develop a presentation using inspiration resources (Resource 1). Reflection Activity: The goal of the reflection activity is to get the learners to start thinking about current knowledge gaps in their institute that they could cover via trainings. Who would the target audience be? The trainer can use the resources to facilitate this activity (Resource 2, 3). You can make the exercise more interesting by asking learners to create a persona for the learners who they will train. Pick a persona and think about what this will mean in terms of training design.

There are various tools to help create learning objectives. The instructor can introduce these (e.g. Blooms Taxonomy \u2013 Resource 1, other guides that the instructor prefers). Introduce what learning activities are and how they help deliver the content and help to meet the learning objectives. Learning activities can have different purposes. The instructor can introduce different approaches as well as how different learning activities can be used for different levels of learning (Example: Fair by Design Methodology Resource 2, 3). Reflection Activity 1: The instructor should introduce a few learning objectives (good and poor) and then provide these examples to the learners for discussion. At the end of the discussion, learners should know the key elements of a good learning objective.

Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Summarise the importance of copyright, open licenses and the role it plays in (re)using educational materials. Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Recognise importance of attribution and how to do it correctly. Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Recognise the difference between using Open Educational Resources (OER) and creating OER. Total Module Duration 2 \u2013 2.5 hours approximately Learning Objective 1 LO1: Summarise the importance of copyright, open licenses and the role it plays in (re)using educational materials. Learning Activities Presentation 1 (30 mins): Introduction to copyright, fair use, and public domain. Introduction to why licensing is used. Activity (45 mins): The trainer can identify 2-3 resources with licenses. Ask participants, in pairs, to identify the license and any restrictions that may come with this license. Discuss what that means if these are reused for teaching. An example activity can be used (Resource 7). Presentation 2 (20 mins): Introduction to creating and licensing your own materials, re-using materials and learning about how to combine existing materials and how to attribute them. This module makes a case for reusing open materials and in turn opening developed materials. Materials to Prepare Slide presentation on copyright, licensing and attribution. Prepare resources for the activities that will give learners practical experience. Instructor Notes Presentation 1: The goal of is to explain the importance of open licensing. The instructor should highlight that in order to utilise various educational materials, licensing has to be understood. The introduction presentation provides a discussion with a focus on distinguishing the differences between copyright, fair use, and public domain. It also provides a discussion about Creative Commons licenses and why they are used. Additionally, the instructor should point out that there are other licenses available and not all potential material for reuse will use Creative Commons (though these are most common). At this time, the instructor can also highlight any specific local licensing regulations (if applicable). It is best to incorporate local regulations as available. Activity: The goal of the activity is to help learners identify what is permitted and not permitted when reusing educational materials with various license types. Presentation 2: A key part of this is making a case for reusing existing materials and by extension why we should make our own developed materials open. When reusing any material, the content license needs to be checked. The instructor can explain strategies on what can be done if using the material is not permissible (for instance, only cite the material or ask for permission for the material from the owner). The instructor can also point to different sources where there is more information on copyright (Resource 6). The instructor can let the learners know that one can combine resources with different licenses. However, the trainer should let learners know that this is a complex part of licensing and one should exercise care when doing so. If the trainer wants to go into further detail, the concept of remixing licenses (Resource 4, 8) can be introduced.
