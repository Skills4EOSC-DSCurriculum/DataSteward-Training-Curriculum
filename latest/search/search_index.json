This system varies according to the computer. However, there is a common aim: The operational system (OS) allows the user to organise the contents of their computer in a hierarchical structure of directories that includes drives, folders, subfolders, and files.</li> <li>File organisation means the information/documents are organised so that a computer can read and understand it. This lets you use the full power of the computer for your analyses and stewardship.</li> <li>Even though files are neatly organised, the content still might have errors or missing data or other problems. It's like you put all your data in the right drawers, but the drawers might still be messy.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Optional Activity:</p> <ul> <li>This activity follows the Library Carpentry lesson on file management.

The instructor can cover information on sorting files, what is good information for file naming, and how to do version control.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Sample first slide <p>The presentation can be kicked off by the following two questions:</p> <ol> <li>Which filename is the most appropriate of the three below and why?<ul> <li><code>2022-03-24_Attachment</code></li> <li><code>24 marts 2022 Attachment</code></li> <li><code>24032022attachment</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>Which file names is the most appropriate of the three below and why?<ul> <li><code>labtox_recent_110810_old_version.sps</code></li> <li><code>2010-08-11_bioasssay_tox_V1.sps</code></li> <li><code>FFTX_3776438656.sps</code></li> </ul> </li> </ol> Detailed key points to cover in the presentation <p>Sorting files: Computers often sort files alphabetically in the file browser. It is therefore a good idea to place the key information at the beginning of the file name. However, the sorting can be changed, e.g. to use the date the file was saved.</p> <p>Sorting by date: If you think you will need to find files by date, place the date the data were created at the start of the file name. The best date format is <code>YYYYMMDDhhmm</code>, as this ensures the files are sorted by year, then month, day and time. Use 24-hour format to avoid confusion about am/pm. When you use the date as the first element, the computer will be able to sort the files in correct chronological order, with either the newest or oldest first.</p> <p>What information is good to include in the file name? Think about what other information is good to include in the file name. For example, the initials of the person who conducted the experiment, performed the interview or collected the information in some other way. You might then add the experiment or interview number, if the data are collected in a specific order.</p> <p>Finally, you might add an abbreviation for the project or assignment. If you create a folder for data solely for a specific project, it might seem unnecessary to include the project name or abbreviation in the file name, but it may still be a good idea, as you might send a file to someone who has a different folder structure. In this case, it is good that they can see which project the file belongs to. Also, file names should be kept short. Try to limit them to 25-30 characters.</p> <p>Elements that can be included in file names are:</p> <ul> <li>The date the file was created</li> <li>Location (where the data were collected)</li> <li>Project name or number</li> <li>Sample number</li> <li>Name of analysis or abbreviation</li> <li>Version number</li> <li>Name (or an abbreviation) of the person who collected the data, conducted the experiment or last worked on the file.</li> </ul> <p>File names must be readable, without compromising on precision. Some software does not like spaces in file names, so you should avoid them. You can replace spaces with <code>-</code> (hyphen) or <code>_</code> (underscore). Or you can start new words with a capital letter. For example:</p> <ul> <li><code>file-name.xxx</code></li> <li><code>file_name.xxx</code></li> <li><code>FileName.xxx</code></li> </ul> <p>Where 'xxx' is the file extension, showing the file type (e.g. .txt, .doc, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx).</p> <p>Avoid special characters such as: <code>~ ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) ` ; : &lt; &gt; ? . , [ ] { } ' \" |</code></p> <p>DO NOT WRITE FILE NAMES ALL IN UPPER-CASE. IT MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO READ.</p> <p>Examples of good file names:</p> <ul> <li><code>20190102_ac_smithlab_utra_exp01_gel_003.tiff</code></li> <li>date_experimentNumber_content_version.fileType: <code>20190501_exp123_analysis_v01.pdf</code></li> <li>date_analysisMethod_topic_version.fileType: <code>20190811_bioassay_toxicity_V1.sps</code> </li> <li>date_journalName_documentName_versionNumber.fileType: <code>2020-plos-manuscript-v26.pdf</code> </li> </ul> <p>Examples of bad file names:</p> <ul> <li><code>Test data 2016.xlsx</code></li> <li><code>Meeting notes Jan 17.doc</code></li> <li><code>Notes Eric.txt</code></li> <li><code>Final FINAL last version.docx</code></li> </ul> <p>Sorting based on types of files and content: If you work with different types of files or data from different sources, equipment or experiments, it is best to store them in separate folders. For example, you could store microscopy images in one folder, questionnaire responses in a second folder and audio files from interviews in a third. When naming your folders, it is important not to use the same subfolder names for different projects. If you send a subfolder containing files to another person, it could be unclear which project the folder belongs to, so include the project name or abbreviation in the name of subfolders.</p> <p>Versions: If you regularly add more data, it might be good to add a version identifier like 'v2' to the file name, e.g. filename_v2.xxx. If you include numbers in the file name, use leading 0s to ensure the files sort correctly (001, 002, 003). If you have a number of files with the following file names: 1, 246, 3, 111, 22, 33 and 2, older systems might sort them as follows: 1, 111, 2, 22, 246, 3, 33.</p> <p>Naming conventions: It is always a good idea to check whether particular naming conventions are used in your subject area. A naming convention is a standardised way of naming files. This is particularly relevant if you expect to share data publicly. If the data are to be kept private, you can name them in whatever way works best for you.</p> <p>Examples of naming conventions:</p> <ul> <li><code>[initials]_[method]_[topic]_[YYYYMMDD]_[version].[xxx]</code></li> <li><code>[project#]_[method]_[version]_[YYYYMMDD].[xxx]</code></li> <li><code>[fileType]_[initials]_[date].[xxx]</code></li> </ul> <p>Reflection Activity:</p> <ul> <li>Prepare instructions for the reflection activity. Include a case to exemplify file organisation and a codex for versioning.</li> <li>Prepare a checklist for file-naming using the information below developed by Copenhagen University working group for Digital Competences (Resource 3).</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Research Data Management","RDM","Data Organisation","File Format"]},{"location":"1%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Format/#resources_1","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Input for the presentation \u2013 for instructors:</p> <ol> <li>Kjorveziroski, V. and Buss, M.

Good file management increases efficiency as information is easily found and understood.</li> <li>Specific consequences of file mismanagement vary depending on the project; however, general risks include legal liability, regulatory non-compliance, duplication of efforts, misunderstanding of data, loss of knowledge during turnover, file obsolescence or corruption, inability to verify information, unclear provenance, and wasted time finding or accessing information.</li> <li>Choosing the right file format is important. The benefits of Open File Formats are increased accessibility, interoperability, longevity and transparency. The disadvantages can be limited features and less technical support.</li> <li>Benefits of Closed File Formats are the have sophisticated features and functionalities, integrate with other proprietary software, and there is good support. Disadvantages are restricted access, limited compatibility, risk of obsolescence, and cost.</li> <li>Effective preservation often requires specialized technical knowledge, which may be lacking in some organizations. Over time, data stored in certain formats can degrade, leading to loss of information and reduced usability.</li> <li>Compatibility Issues: As new software and systems emerge, older formats may become incompatible, making data retrieval difficult.</li> <li>Data Sensitivity: Consider privacy and security implications, particularly for sensitive or confidential data.</li> <li>Licensing: Be aware of any licensing restrictions that might affect the use and distribution of the chosen format. Consider who needs to access the data and ensure the format chosen facilitates broad accessibility and collaboration.</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Research Data Management","RDM","Data Organisation","File Format"]},{"location":"1%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Format/#resources_4","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Input for file conversion exercise \u2013 resources for the instructor:</p> <ol> <li>Converting from One File Type to Another | Computing. https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/converting-one-file-type-another.</li> </ol> <p>Resources about obsolescence \u2013 slide preparation for instructors:</p> <ol> <li>Obsolescence: File Formats and Software | Digital Preservation Management. https://dpworkshop.org/dpm-eng/oldmedia/obsolescence1.html.</li> </ol> <p>Identifying a file extension and the software needed to open it:</p> <ol> <li>FileInfo.Com - The File Format Database. https://fileinfo.com/.</li> </ol> <p>Resources for slide development \u2013 for instructors:</p> <ol> <li>Administrator.

A) The use of a standardised research methodology across disciplines.     B) Accessing, using, or sharing sensitive data such as health or personal data.     C) Adhering to legal requirements set by professional organisations.     D) Collecting data that is already publicly available.     Correct Answer: B</li> <li>Why is legal compliance not always sufficient to ensure ethical behaviour?     A) Legal compliance primarily focuses on cultural values rather than principles of conduct.     B) Legal compliance may only address minimal requirements, leaving ethical concerns unresolved.

The instructor can choose to go into more detail using the suggested resources. An alternative way to address this topic is to make the learners aware of the resources and experts within their organisation that they could approach for more information.</p> <p>Pre-session reading:</p> <ul> <li>Topics to be covered:<ul> <li>Information about European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the main standard for ensuring ethical practices in EU-funded research. The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity serves the European research community as a framework for self-regulation across all scientific and scholarly disciplines and for all research settings. The European Commission recognises the European Code of Conduct as the primary standard for upholding research integrity across all research projects funded by the EU (Resource 1).</li> <li>Information about Horizon Europe's Ethics Appraisal Procedure, which involves pre-project ethics reviews and ongoing checks to ensure compliance and minimise risks to researchers and subjects. The aim is to ascertain that expected standards are met and that risks to research subjects and researchers are minimised. Horizon Europe puts in place an Ethics Appraisal Procedure which includes:<ul> <li>1) the Ethics Review Procedure conducted before the start of the project, and</li> <li>2) Ethics Checks, Reviews and Audits conducted during the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Information for EU project applicants and beneficiaries to ensure their proposals are ethics-compliant. It covers common ethics issues, offers advice on addressing them, and assists with filling out applications. This guidance in Resource 4 is designed to help applicants and beneficiaries of EU projects make their proposal ethics-compliant. The guidance will help them identify and deal with ethics issues that may arise from their project and provide help with filling out your application. It covers most of the ethics issues that usually arise in EU projects and gives advice on dealing with classic cases.</li> <li>As background, share with learners that the principles of the European Code of Conduct are important for all areas of research \u2013 whether publicly funded or privately conducted \u2013 and apply across disciplines. It can serve as a foundation for local, national, and field-specific guidelines, and it is designed to cover both many research methods, including approaches like citizen science or participatory research.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Activity:</p> <ul> <li>The activity will help learners to identify the right experts within their institution.</li> </ul> <p>Optional activity:</p> <ul> <li>The instructor can also prepare 2\u20133 case studies, using short descriptions of Horizon Europe projects. These could be based on existing projects if the instructor has worked with some, with details modified to extract some ethical concerns, for which learners would then make ethical assessments, while explaining the decisions they would make.</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Ethics"]},{"location":"5%20Ethics/02_Ethical-Guidelines-and-Legislation-Relevant-to-Research/#resources_1","title":"Resources","text":"<ol> <li>Allea.
