In addition, we consulted with data stewards, data management and open science specialists to help us identify what topics were most relevant to the curriculum.</p> <p>Each module listed above is expanded further to outline its content and structure, and below we will elaborate on each of these components and what we intend with them. At the top of each module, you will find an overview of the learning objectives and the total duration needed to complete the activities suggested in the module (note that this does not include prep time by the instructor). We then expand the module's content according to each learning objective, so that an instructor can clearly identify what the different materials and activities are intended to help achieve.</p> <p>The curriculum is both comprehensive and modular, so that an instructor may choose as many sections (or if necessary, modules) as they like. The components below are intended to help guide the trainer in using the material, and provide tips and activities to shape teaching and learning.</p> <p>A note on Open and FAIR: Instead of creating standalone sections or modules on Open Science and the FAIR principles, these concepts instead run through our curriculum, providing a framework as we expand on different topics of data stewardship in relation to them.</p>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Data Steward"]},{"location":"#inside-the-curriculum","title":"Inside the curriculum","text":"<p>A guide to what the different terms mentioned in our curriculum mean:</p> <ul> <li>Learning Objectives: We use the backwards design instructional model in our curriculum, that is, we begin with learning objectives, or what we intend for learners to learn from each module. We are guided by the action verbs in Bloom's Taxonomy, so as to make the learning objectives as clear and actionable as possible. A module may have one or more learning objectives, depending on its scope. Using the learning objective as our base, we then expand onto other aspects of the module that are intended to enable the achievement of this learning objective.</li> <li>Module Duration: An approximation of how long given material and activities will take to cover, but it is completely at the instructor's discretion to use more or less time, based on the learners in question and the scope of the training session. If some materials/activities are better suited to preparatory or post-session work, that adaptation is possible.</li> <li>Learning Activities: Activities that a trainer could use in the training to cover the given topic. A wide range of activities are suggested which include:<ul> <li>Slide presentations/Lectures: A presentation or lecture from the trainer introducing the topic to the learners is often one of the first activities mentioned in the modules. We do not provide the slides themselves as we want the material to be adaptable to context, but we equip the trainer with resources (where possible) to create the slides, and point to any existing lectures or material on the topics. In some cases we outline the key points that the instructor should cover.</li> <li>Discussion/Reflection activities: These are meant to assess how learners have engaged with the material, and also enable them to reflect critically on it.</li> <li>Quizzes: Short quizzes to assess how learners have absorbed the content (usually self assessed, but trainers can choose how to use them).</li> <li>Role-play or Think-activities: Taking on roles (such as a data steward role) to work through various practical scenarios.</li> <li>Pre-session activities: Pre-assigned reading or self-paced material/coursework to follow before a session, usually followed by a recap and other learning activities in the session itself.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Materials to Prepare: Based on suggested activities for a particular module, we identify what materials a instructor may need to prepare for the session (slide presentations, questions to guide a discussion, case studies to illustrate specific points).</li> <li>Resources: As our curriculum attempts to reuse as many existing resources as possible, we have tried to link to helpful materials that can help curate the sessions. These could be used to design slide presentations, assign reading to the learners, pick up case studies for discussions and role play scenarios, among others.</li> <li>Instructor Notes: Here we include additional information that the instructor could use to teach the module. Sometimes these are key takeaways or messages to impart, or suggestions to guide a particular activity or presentation, or how to use a particular resource. We have tried to be as explicit and comprehensive as possible with how the material is intended for use, while still trying to leave room for flexibility, for an instructor to adapt to a specific group of learners or other context.</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Data Steward"]},{"location":"#co-creation","title":"Co-creation","text":"<p>The curriculum has been developed by a working group of people from the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Denmark, Finland, the UK, Spain and Greece, and reviewed by many helpful reviewers who helped shape the content (a full list of contributors and more detail about the curriculum development process is available in our Deliverable Report).</p> <p>As a result of being worked on by so many different people at different stages, you may observe some differences between the sections as you navigate the curriculum. While we have tried to streamline this as much as possible, it is important to keep in mind that the curriculum brings together a diversity of perspectives, and sections reflect these differences. Some sections like Research Data Management have more detail and material than others, and we have chosen to retain this and hope that instructors will find the additional information helpful in designing a training. In some modules, you may find more detail in the learning activities, and more general guidance in the instructor notes, and in some it may be the reverse. These reflect the different approaches of the sub-groups that worked on the material, and we encourage you to read all the material associated with the module to get a sense of the guidance and materials available. Despite the challenges of working with a large group, we are happy to have had many content experts help us build this curriculum, enabling us to provide as wide of a base as possible from which instructors can choose what they find most useful and interesting.</p>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Data Steward"]},{"location":"#authors-and-contributors","title":"Authors and Contributors","text":"<p>Nida van Leersum, Saba Sharma, Achim Winandi, Paula Martinez Lavanchy, Fernando Aguilar, Tuulikki Alamett\u00e4l\u00e4, Diane Antoine, Mathilde Bernier, Valentina Colcelli, Benjamin Derksen, Kasper Drazewski, Dominique Green, Christine Hadrossek, Joanna Janik, Karsten Kryger Hansen, Carolin Leister, Per M\u00f8ldrup-Dalum, Marta Musidlowska, Ekaterina Peters, Giorgos Psathas, P\u00e4ivi Rauste, Luca Schirru, Fabian Schub\u00f6, Lorna Wildgaard</p>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Data Steward"]},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Data Steward"]},{"location":"#reuse","title":"Reuse","text":"<p>The curriculum is free to reuse and adapt in any way by trainers, within the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license applied to the materials.

The aim is to give an overview of data sharing challenges in research and how FAIR principles address them. Use real-world examples of FAIR data implementation to explain the principles.</li> <li>Explain why the FAIR principles are being taught. The main objective of FAIR is to increase data reuse by researchers. The core concepts of the FAIR principles are based on good scientific practice and intuitively grounded. As data stewards, it will be the learners' job to support good research practice and the implementation of the FAIR principles.</li> <li>Each principle can be explained at a time. For each principle show case how they can be applied. For example, how licences help Reusability and how metadata help Findability, Reusability and Interoperability. Explain how the principles are implemented using data management plans, persistent identifiers, licences for datasets, metadata and using tools such as repositories. For better illustration of the implementation of the FAIR principle, the instructor can highlighting where in the research project life cycle FAIR principles can be applied and where support may be provided. Consider including an interactive quiz such as a Kahoot to assess the learners understanding of FAIR/non-FAIR data practices with regard to the FAIR principles.</li> <li>The instructor can cover the following key takeaways:<ul> <li>\"Open\" data and FAIR data: Ensure learners grasp the difference between \"open\" data and FAIR data. Be clear that FAIR principles are guidelines, not strict rules, and that flexibility is essential. FAIR principles are designed to make data reusable and more accessible.</li> <li>Sharing data using FAIR principles leads to more reproducible and impactful research.</li> <li>Accessibility is not just about Open Data but making data \"as open as possible, as closed as necessary.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>Make sure learners understand that the metadata for a given dataset is often linked to the data repository where it has been published. For instance, in Zenodo, the metadata is very basic, whereas in disciplinary repositories, for instance the Cambridge Structural Database, the metadata is much more detailed. Accordingly, address discipline-specific considerations for implementing FAIR principles in different fields, for example differences in metadata standards or data formats.</li> </ul> <p>Case Studies:</p> <ul> <li>Prepare three cases as below and share it with the learners:<ul> <li>1) find a \"good example\" dataset that has been made \"FAIR\",</li> <li>2) a dataset where the metadata or usage licence is missing, and</li> <li>3) where the format is outdated.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For each dataset, ask learners to check if all the elements/practices to implement the FAIR principles discussed are present. Is there any principle that does not entirely apply to these datasets? What would be your recommendations to improve them.</li> <li>Prepare questions for the learners to work with such as: which metadata would be appropriate to add to Case 2, how can we ensure that data is usable in years to come, which formats could we recommend (Case 3).</li> <li>Many libraries provide guides to where you can find teachable datasets, such as those linked in Resources 1\u20133.

The instructor can cover information on sorting files, what is good information for file naming, and how to do version control.</p> <p>The presentation can be kicked off by the following two questions:</p> <ol> <li>Which filename is the most appropriate of the three below and why?<ul> <li><code>2022-03-24_Attachment</code></li> <li><code>24 marts 2022 Attachment</code></li> <li><code>24032022attachment</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>Which file names is the most appropriate of the three below and why?<ul> <li><code>labtox_recent_110810_old_version.sps</code></li> <li><code>2010-08-11_bioasssay_tox_V1.sps</code></li> <li><code>FFTX_3776438656.sps</code></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Below are the key points the instructor can cover in their presentation:</p> <p>Sorting files: Computers often sort files alphabetically in the file browser. It is therefore a good idea to place the key information at the beginning of the file name. However, the sorting can be changed, e.g. to use the date the file was saved.</p> <p>Sorting by date: If you think you will need to find files by date, place the date the data were created at the start of the file name. The best date format is <code>YYYYMMDDhhmm</code>, as this ensures the files are sorted by year, then month, day and time. Use 24-hour format to avoid confusion about am/pm. When you use the date as the first element, the computer will be able to sort the files in correct chronological order, with either the newest or oldest first.</p> <p>What information is good to include in the file name? Think about what other information is good to include in the file name. For example, the initials of the person who conducted the experiment, performed the interview or collected the information in some other way. You might then add the experiment or interview number, if the data are collected in a specific order.</p> <p>Finally, you might add an abbreviation for the project or assignment. If you create a folder for data solely for a specific project, it might seem unnecessary to include the project name or abbreviation in the file name, but it may still be a good idea, as you might send a file to someone who has a different folder structure. In this case, it is good that they can see which project the file belongs to. Also, file names should be kept short. Try to limit them to 25\u201330 characters.</p> <p>Elements that can be included in file names are:</p> <ul> <li>The date the file was created</li> <li>Location (where the data were collected)</li> <li>Project name or number</li> <li>Sample number</li> <li>Name of analysis or abbreviation</li> <li>Version number</li> <li>Name (or an abbreviation) of the person who collected the data, conducted the experiment or last worked on the file.</li> </ul> <p>File names must be readable, without compromising on precision. Some software does not like spaces in file names, so you should avoid them. You can replace spaces with <code>-</code> (hyphen) or <code>_</code> (underscore). Or you can start new words with a capital letter. For example:</p> <ul> <li><code>file-name.xxx</code></li> <li><code>file_name.xxx</code></li> <li><code>FileName.xxx</code></li> </ul> <p>Where 'xxx' is the file extension, showing the file type (e.g. .txt, .doc, .csv, .pdf, .xlsx).</p> <p>Avoid special characters such as: <code>~ ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) ` ; : &lt; &gt; ? . , [ ] { } ' \" |</code></p> <p>DO NOT WRITE FILE NAMES ALL IN UPPER-CASE. IT MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO READ.</p> <p>Examples of good file names:</p> <ul> <li><code>20190102_ac_smithlab_utra_exp01_gel_003.tiff</code></li> <li>date_experimentNumber_content_version.fileType: <code>20190501_exp123_analysis_v01.pdf</code></li> <li>date_analysisMethod_topic_version.fileType: <code>20190811_bioassay_toxicity_V1.sps</code> </li> <li>date_journalName_documentName_versionNumber.fileType: <code>2020-plos-manuscript-v26.pdf</code> </li> </ul> <p>Examples of bad file names:</p> <ul> <li><code>Test data 2016.xlsx</code></li> <li><code>Meeting notes Jan 17.doc</code></li> <li><code>Notes Eric.txt</code></li> <li><code>Final FINAL last version.docx</code></li> </ul> <p>Sorting based on types of files and content: If you work with different types of files or data from different sources, equipment or experiments, it is best to store them in separate folders. For example, you could store microscopy images in one folder, questionnaire responses in a second folder and audio files from interviews in a third. When naming your folders, it is important not to use the same subfolder names for different projects. If you send a subfolder containing files to another person, it could be unclear which project the folder belongs to, so include the project name or abbreviation in the name of subfolders.</p> <p>Versions: If you regularly add more data, it might be good to add a version identifier like 'v2' to the file name, e.g. filename_v2.xxx. If you include numbers in the file name, use leading 0s to ensure the files sort correctly (001, 002, 003). If you have a number of files with the following file names: 1, 246, 3, 111, 22, 33 and 2, older systems might sort them as follows: 1, 111, 2, 22, 246, 3, 33.</p> <p>Naming conventions: It is always a good idea to check whether particular naming conventions are used in your subject area. A naming convention is a standardised way of naming files. This is particularly relevant if you expect to share data publicly. If the data are to be kept private, you can name them in whatever way works best for you.</p> <p>Examples of naming conventions:</p> <ul> <li><code>[initials]_[method]_[topic]_[YYYYMMDD]_[version].[xxx]</code></li> <li><code>[project#]_[method]_[version]_[YYYYMMDD].[xxx]</code></li> <li><code>[fileType]_[initials]_[date].[xxx]</code></li> </ul> <p>Reflection Activity:</p> <ul> <li>Prepare instructions for the reflection activity. Include a case to exemplify file organisation and a codex for versioning.</li> <li>Prepare a checklist for file-naming using the information below developed by Copenhagen University working group for Digital Competences (Resource 3).</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Research Data Management","RDM","Data Organisation","File Format"]},{"location":"2%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Formats/#resources_1","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Input for the presentation \u2013 for instructors:</p> <ol> <li>Kjorveziroski, V. and Buss, M.

Obsolescence refers to the process by which file formats, software, or hardware become outdated and unusable over time. Factors that contribute to obsolescence are technological advancements, propriety formats and lack of documentation. Obsolescence needs to be addressed in a disciplinary and project context.</li> <li>Open and closed file formats serve various purposes and have unique characteristics, including how they handle data, compatibility with software, and ease of access, and these need to be considered in file conversion. Therefore converting files between formats can impact data integrity and usability, affecting the reliability and accessibility of the information.</li> <li>Data Integrity: How does the conversion process affect data integrity and usability?</li> <li>Data ethics: Which considerations did you have about security, privacy and ethical/legal issues?</li> <li>Long-Term Access: What measures can be taken to ensure long-term access and prevent obsolescence?</li> <li>Preservation: Which strategies could be recommended to mitigate obsolescence?</li> <li>Ethical Considerations: How do open formats align with ethical standards in their specific research field?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Help the learners assess the security and privacy of converted files. Consider how easily the data can be accessed, modified, or shared without authorisation. Discuss the usability of the files in different formats after conversion.

Give more time than you think for the case work and discussion afterwards, as there are many issues that can be discussed!</p> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <ul> <li>File management is the organisation, structure, naming, accessing, and storing of documents. Good file management increases efficiency as information is easily found and understood.</li> <li>Specific consequences of file mismanagement vary depending on the project; however, general risks include legal liability, regulatory non-compliance, duplication of efforts, misunderstanding of data, loss of knowledge during turnover, file obsolescence or corruption, inability to verify information, unclear provenance, and wasted time finding or accessing information.</li> <li>Choosing the right file format is important. The benefits of open file formats are increased accessibility, interoperability, longevity and transparency. The disadvantages can be limited features and less technical support.</li> <li>Benefits of Closed File Formats are that they have sophisticated features and functionalities, integrate with other proprietary software, and there is good support. Disadvantages are restricted access, limited compatibility, risk of obsolescence, and cost.</li> <li>Effective preservation often requires specialised technical knowledge, which may be lacking in some organisations. Over time, data stored in certain formats can degrade, leading to loss of information and reduced usability.</li> <li>Compatibility Issues: As new software and systems emerge, older formats may become incompatible, making data retrieval difficult.</li> <li>Data Sensitivity: Consider privacy and security implications, particularly for sensitive or confidential data.</li> <li>Licensing: Be aware of any licensing restrictions that might affect the use and distribution of the chosen format. Consider who needs to access the data and ensure the format chosen facilitates broad accessibility and collaboration.</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Research Data Management","RDM","Data Organisation","File Format"]},{"location":"2%20Research%20Data%20Management/03_Data-Organisation-and-File-Formats/#resources_4","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Input for file conversion exercise \u2013 for instructors:</p> <ol> <li>Converting from One File Type to Another | Computing. https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/converting-one-file-type-another.</li> </ol> <p>Resources about obsolescence \u2013 slide preparation for instructors:</p> <ol> <li>Obsolescence: File Formats and Software | Digital Preservation Management. https://dpworkshop.org/dpm-eng/oldmedia/obsolescence1.html.</li> </ol> <p>Identifying a file extension and the software needed to open it:</p> <ol> <li>FileInfo.Com - The File Format Database. https://fileinfo.com/.</li> </ol> <p>Resources for slide development \u2013 for instructors:</p> <ol> <li>Administrator.

The driving point is to open students up to the reality that metadata is used all the time, everywhere in every day life in small, invisible but meaningful ways (ranging from the contents descriptions on a can of soup to your phone's metadata on a phone call). The instructor can then move to how metadata works within a data steward's portfolio of tasks.</li> <li>Discussion (90 mins): Discussion about the metadata used in the Edward Snowden case (Resources 8, 9). What does the metadata reveal? How can different bits of metadata contribute to a broader picture of meaning? How does it \"tell a story\" (true or not) or realise something that could be relayed with semantic meaning? The instructor can also choose another news source.</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Research Data Management","RDM","Metadata"]},{"location":"2%20Research%20Data%20Management/04_Metadata/#materials-to-prepare","title":"Materials to Prepare","text":"<ul> <li>Lecture slides to be drawn from material in Resources 4\u20137.</li> <li>Facilitate discussion by presenting the Edward Snowden case or another news source and broad points about the Snowden leaks to guide the conversation.</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Research Data Management","RDM","Metadata"]},{"location":"2%20Research%20Data%20Management/04_Metadata/#instructor-notes","title":"Instructor Notes","text":"<p>Lecture:</p> <ul> <li>Metadata is a key tool in everyday life \u2013 metadata is a kind of infrastructure, it becomes visible upon breakdown.</li> <li>Go through the types of metadata and highlight their use in a data stewardship context.

These relations are visualised in the Visualization tab. We found the class 'village' ('larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town'), which is also used in many other ontologies (see under Mappings).

Advocating for the why rather than the how, which is addressed in LO2.

Talk about the advantages too, such as how implementing the FAIR principles helps in the reproducibility crisis (discipline-dependent).</li> <li>Focus on balancing benefits with realistic constraints.<ul> <li>There are common concerns (intellectual property, data security, lack of technical skills) about how to work FAIR and also advantages (for example making data FAIR can help secure funding and collaborations) which the data steward will need to mediate. Hence, there are valid concerns about FAIR data, but they can be managed with the right strategies.</li> <li>FAIR data benefits the scientific community and increases research visibility.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The activities encourage the learners to articulate the FAIR agenda and consider FAIR from the perspective of researchers and data stewards.</li> <li>In this last lesson, talk about how FAIR principles are interwoven in other data stewardship concepts. Identify for example how other modules in the curriculum build on the FAIR principles (metadata, data quality).This will encourage the learner to think critically across the curriculum and the complexity of the tasks they are working with as data stewards on a deeper level. Make sure learners understand how FAIR connects with broader data stewardship topics and encourage learners to identify their learning needs for future modules.</li> <li>FAIR is a foundational concept that informs all aspects of data stewardship.

Certain tools or strategies may be more common in particular disciplines.</li> </ul> <p>Discussion:</p> <ul> <li>Begin with a brief recap of the FAIR principles and the importance of making data FAIR (depending on how the instructor is teaching the module, these can be covered by materials in Learning Objective 1).</li> <li>Present and share the handout, which provides a summary of key elements to make data FAIR (for example, (machine-readable) metadata, PIDs, repositories, open and interoperable formats, licences).The activity will give an overview of tools supporting FAIR data (for example, Zenodo, Figshare, Dataverse). The purpose is to provide a more \"hands-on\" introduction to workflows for metadata generation, data storage, and archiving (more information about this can be found in the module on Data Preservation and Archiving). It is important to use time explaining licensing options (for instance, Creative Commons) that align with FAIR principles.</li> <li>Key Takeaways are:<ul> <li>Not all tools are equally suitable for every type of data or research project.</li> <li>Many tools (such as repositories, metadata creators, ReadMe file templates etc.) exist to facilitate FAIR data, some are more complicated than others. Test the appropriateness of the tool before recommending to learners or including in the workshop material.</li> <li>Choosing the right tool depends on the specific research needs.</li> <li>Well-structured metadata is crucial for making data findable and reusable.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The instructor can highlight that each FAIR principle plays a crucial role in ensuring that data can be easily discovered, accessed, integrated, and reused by other researchers and stakeholders. Assigning persistent identifiers, such as DOIs to datasets ensures they are reliably referenced and can be easily located over time. PIDs enhance the Findability and credibility of research outputs. Using standardised formats and controlled vocabularies facilitates data Interoperability, allowing datasets to be easily integrated and analysed alongside other data. This is vital for collaborative research and data sharing across disciplines. Familiarity with the tools and resources (for example metadata generators, repositories, FAIR evaluation tools) is essential for effectively implementing FAIR principles in practice. FAIR principles are also the first step for a reproducible research. These tools help streamline the process of making data FAIR.</li> <li>Learners can also be asked to share their own inputs about other tools or strategies they know of that can help make data FAIR.</li> </ul> Handout for Discussion Activity <p>The suggested handout can be a list that prompts the learners to think about the tools and workflows for each principle or developed further as an online resource with links to examples and more information. It can also be used by the learners to assess the FAIRness of repositories and other services.</p> <p>Prepare a detailed explanation of technical strategies that can be employed for each FAIR principle. The list below can be:</p> <ol> <li>Findable<ul> <li>Persistent Identifiers (PIDs): Assign globally unique and persistent identifiers (DOIs, Handles) to your data and metadata so that it can be reliably found and referenced. Examples include:<ul> <li>DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for datasets (DataCite, Zenodo).</li> <li>ORCID iDs for author identification.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Metadata: Create and publish rich metadata using standard schemas (e.g., Dublin Core, DataCite).

Selecting the right licence balances openness with necessary restrictions, fostering trust and ethical reuse while protecting intellectual contributions.</li> <li>Data citations, just like research article citations, give proper credit to data creators and encourage responsible reuse.</li> <li>Connecting datasets to code, research software, and publications provides the provenance of the research process and help the advancement of science. Breaking a single big journal publication containing everything into these smaller pieces values each step of the research process; the researcher does not only focus on publishing interpretations, but also puts effort into data collection and publishing.

Exception: databases created by means of sensors or other physical components of connected products and other machine-generated data which are governed by the Data Act. Note: for the \"new\" data legislative framework there is much less guidance when it comes to practical application than for GDPR or copyright aspects (Resources 1\u20133).</li> <li>Territoriality of copyright: Copyright is territorial and fragmented in the EU \u2013 not benefitting from full harmonisation (Resource 1).</li> <li>Direct applicability: Digital regulation like the Data Act or the Digital Governance Act benefits from direct applicability \u2013 fragmentation is much less of an issue (Resource 1).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Discussion activity:</p> <ul> <li>The live session of the module should be used to facilitate a discussion that will prompt the learners to critically assess the content covered in the pre-requisite.</li> <li>Before opening the main discussion during the live session, it is recommended to start by asking learners to establish individual relevance by providing practical examples from their professional context (learners could be told to think of some examples before the session, as part of the pre-session activities) \u2013 this can also give the instructor an opportunity to get a feeling of how understandable the self-paced part has been.</li> </ul>","tags":["Skills4EOSC","DataStewardship","Curriculum","Usage Rights","Licenses"]},{"location":"5%20Usage%20Rights%20and%20Licenses/01_EU-Copyright-Law-and-Data-Digital-Legislation/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Pre-session activity:</p> <ol> <li>Skills4EOSC Evidence-Informed Decision-Making Train of Trainers Course 2: Module07 - Lecture01 -- Open Science and Non-Personal Data, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0VdCRlnNy8.</li> </ol> <p>Recommended supplementary reading:</p> <ol> <li>Dr\u0105\u017cewski, Kasper, et al.

The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity serves the European research community as a framework for self-regulation across all scientific and scholarly disciplines and for all research settings. The European Commission recognises the European Code of Conduct as the primary standard for upholding research integrity across all research projects funded by the EU (Resource 1).</li> <li>Information about Horizon Europe's Ethics Appraisal Procedure, which involves pre-project ethics reviews and ongoing checks to ensure compliance and minimise risks to researchers and subjects. The aim is to ascertain that expected standards are met and that risks to research subjects and researchers are minimised. Horizon Europe puts in place an Ethics Appraisal Procedure which includes:<ul> <li>1) the Ethics Review Procedure conducted before the start of the project, and</li> <li>2) Ethics Checks, Reviews and Audits conducted during the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Information for EU project applicants and beneficiaries to ensure their proposals are ethics-compliant. It covers common ethics issues, offers advice on addressing them, and assists with filling out applications. This guidance in Resource 4 is designed to help applicants and beneficiaries of EU projects make their proposal ethics-compliant. The guidance will help them identify and deal with ethics issues that may arise from their project and provide help with filling out your application. It covers most of the ethics issues that usually arise in EU projects and gives advice on dealing with classic cases.</li> <li>As background, share with learners that the principles of the European Code of Conduct are important for all areas of research \u2013 whether publicly funded or privately conducted \u2013 and apply across disciplines. It can serve as a foundation for local, national, and field-specific guidelines, and it is designed to cover both many research methods, including approaches like citizen science or participatory research.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Activity:</p> <ul> <li>The activity will help learners to identify the right experts within their institution.</li> </ul> <p>Optional activity:</p> <ul> <li>The instructor can also prepare 2\u20133 case studies, using short descriptions of Horizon Europe projects.
