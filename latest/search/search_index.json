Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Recognise the target audience and their learning needs. Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Design a training for the target audience to meet the learning objectives. Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Plan how to gather feedback for further improvement in lesson development. Learning Objective 4 (LO4): Identify context-specific resources for training and use these to design learning activities. Total Module Duration 3 hours Learning Objective 1 LO1: Recognise the target audience and their learning needs. Learning Activities Presentation/video (15 mins): Start off with an introduction on why a trainer needs to identify their target audience, and how to identify the needs of a target audience. Explain that the trainer should be clear in what they want the target audience to achieve (10 mins). Reflection Activity (30 mins): In breakout groups of 3-4 participants, think about and discuss what possible target audiences Data Stewards might need to train and what training needs they could have. Exercise (15 mins): A hands on exercise to map out the purpose of the training need by identifying the target audience and their possible RDM needs. Use a planning template for this exercise (e.g. the EOSC synergy training template \u2013 Resource 3). Materials to Prepare Presentation on what is a target audience and why to consider their needs when designing a training. Activity and Exercise: Facilitate the learners to think of their context for trainings and consider the target audience and their possible training needs. Instructor Notes Presentation on target audience and learning needs: Once the Data Steward has identified what the problem is and why a training is needed they can design the learning objectives of the training. Then the next step is to identify the target audience. The trainer can highlight the importance of this so that the training can be best designed for that target audience to solve the identified problem together over the course of the training. It is important to assess the target audience's level of expertise. The prior knowledge will determine if a training will start with defining key concepts vs. building upon prior knowledge. As a trainer the data steward should also have to think of how best to deliver a training that meets the learning needs of the target audience (e.g. Think of busy professionals and how this will impact the design of the training). The trainer can develop a presentation using inspiration resources (Resource 1). Reflection Activity: The goal of the reflection activity is to get the learners to start thinking about current knowledge gaps in their institute that they could cover via trainings. Who would the target audience be? The trainer can use the resources to facilitate this activity (Resource 2, 3). You can make the exercise more interesting by asking learners to create a persona for the learners who they will train. Pick a persona and think about what this will mean in terms of training design. Exercise: The trainer can introduce some tools that can be used to identify the target audience and their training needs (Resources 2, 3).

Learning Objective 2 LO2: Design a training for the target audience to meet the learning objectives. Learning Activities Presentation (30 mins): Introduction to creating learning objectives (for instance, using Bloom\\'s Taxonomy), emphasising the importance of using measurable verbs in designing learning objectives. Introduction to some examples of common learning activities and the role that learning activities play in meeting the learning objectives. Reflection activity 1 (15 mins): Instructor presents a learning objective. Evaluate whether this is a clear, measurable learning objective. How can it be improved? Reflection activity 2 (15 mins): What are three kinds of learning activities that you find most effective as a learner? In breakout groups, discuss. Materials to Prepare Presentation on creating good learning objectives and what makes them good. Activity 1: Have a list of good and bad learning objectives to compare. Activity 2: Facilitate how to match learning objectives to learning activities. Instructor Notes Presentation 1: Creating learning objectives \u2013 Introduce the concept of learning objectives \u2013 what is the overall goal and purpose of the training and which learning goals will help achieve this. When developing learning objectives, keep in mind that they should be measurable, can be assessed and are realistic to achieve in the time of the training. There are various tools to help create learning objectives. The instructor can introduce these (e.g. Blooms Taxonomy \u2013 Resource 1, other guides that the instructor prefers). Introduce what learning activities are and how they help deliver the content and help to meet the learning objectives. Learning activities can have different purposes. The instructor can introduce different approaches as well as how different learning activities can be used for different levels of learning (Example: Fair by Design Methodology Resource 2, 3). Reflection Activity 1: The instructor should introduce a few learning objectives (good and poor) and then provide these examples to the learners for discussion. At the end of the discussion, learners should know the key elements of a good learning objective. Reflection Activity 2: The goal of this activity is to introduce various learning activities and discuss how the learner is being engaged, for instance, video, case study, discussion, and so on. The trainer could also use learning activities from this training to use as an example (Resource 3). The trainer can introduce ice breakers that can be embedded into the training (Resource 4).

Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Summarise the importance of copyright, open licenses and the role it plays in (re)using educational materials. Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Recognise importance of attribution and how to do it correctly. Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Recognise the difference between using Open Educational Resources (OER) and creating OER. Total Module Duration 2 \u2013 2.5 hours approximately Learning Objective 1 LO1: Summarise the importance of copyright, open licenses and the role it plays in (re)using educational materials. Learning Activities Presentation 1 (30 mins): Introduction to copyright, fair use, and public domain. Introduction to why licensing is used. Activity (45 mins): The trainer can identify 2-3 resources with licenses. Ask participants, in pairs, to identify the license and any restrictions that may come with this license. Discuss what that means if these are reused for teaching. An example activity can be used (Resource 7). Presentation 2 (20 mins): Introduction to creating and licensing your own materials, re-using materials and learning about how to combine existing materials and how to attribute them. This module makes a case for reusing open materials and in turn opening developed materials. Materials to Prepare Slide presentation on copyright, licensing and attribution. Prepare resources for the activities that will give learners practical experience. Instructor Notes Presentation 1 The goal of is to explain the importance of open licensing. The instructor should highlight that in order to utilise various educational materials, licensing has to be understood. The introduction presentation provides a discussion with a focus on distinguishing the differences between copyright, fair use, and public domain. It also provides a discussion about Creative Commons licenses and why they are used. Additionally, the instructor should point out that there are other licenses available and not all potential material for reuse will use Creative Commons (though these are most common). At this time, the instructor can also highlight any specific local licensing regulations (if applicable). It is best to incorporate local regulations as available. Activity The goal of the activity is to help learners identify what is permitted and not permitted when reusing educational materials with various license types. Presentation 2 A key part of this is making a case for reusing existing materials and by extension why we should make our own developed materials open. When reusing any material, the content license needs to be checked. The instructor can explain strategies on what can be done if using the material is not permissible (for instance, only cite the material or ask for permission for the material from the owner). The instructor can also point to different sources where there is more information on copyright (Resource 6). The instructor can let the learners know that one can combine resources with different licenses. However, the trainer should let learners know that this is a complex part of licensing and one should exercise care when doing so. If the trainer wants to go into further detail, the concept of remixing licenses (Resource 4, 8) can be introduced.

Learning Objective 2 LO2: Recognise importance of attribution and how to do it correctly. Learning Activities Presentation (20 mins): Introduction to attribution. Activity (10 mins): Give the participants image and text from different sources. Ask them to attribute the image or text using attribution best practices (for example, TASL, Resource 3). Materials to Prepare Slide presentation on attribution. Activity requires links to resources or learners can be asked to think of resources they may use in their trainings. Instructor Notes Presentation The learner is introduced the importance of attribution when reusing sources due to it being covered by the law. The instructor can provide the TASL method as one method of attribution (Title, Author, Source, License) The instructor can also introduce tools that can help in attribution (Resource 3). Activity This activity lets learners get practical experience with attribution. The instructor can prepare resources in advance or let learners choose their own resources and attribute them.

Learning Objective 3 LO3: Recognise the difference between using Open Educational Resources (OER) and creating OER. Learning Activities Presentation (30 mins): Introduction to Open Educational resources and their role in the reuse of materials for training purposes. Activity (15 mins): The trainer can identify a few starting places to find OER. The learners can search these databases for OER as related to their subject area or field. This can be done as an individual activity or in pairs. Materials to Prepare Slide presentation Open Educational Resources. Group or solo work on exploring sites that house OER. Instructor Notes Presentation The main aim is to provide a definition of Open Educational Resources and describe the benefits and challenges of utilising OER for training purposes. The instructor can also present the differences between OER and other free educational materials. There is opportunity in this presentation provide a history of OERs and explore early initiatives dedicated to the idea of reusable learning. Activity The aim of the activity is to give the trainees hands-on opportunity to exploring databases and/or websites that house OER. Learners can use this time to identify helpful OER for their roles or potential future training obligations. Discussions can include the usefulness of the site and what resources were available.

Group work on engaging with training. Instructor Notes Presentation: The instructor can introduce the importance of engagement during a training. The instructor can discuss how repetition (in different ways) is useful for remembering concepts such as using written text to back up speech because hearing and seeing helps to remember concepts. Engaging the participants - Introduce the idea of the trainer as a performer and how to keep the attention of learners which can vary depending the modality of the training (face to face versus online). Little tricks could include varying speech patterns, tone, and intonation. The instructor should address that teaching adults is different from teaching children and discuss some key aspects (Resource 1). Group work: The trainer can explain how learners are engaged via learning activities. However the trainer can also emphasis to the group how motivation and demotivation works (Resource 1).

The session can introduce the participants to the theory of code of conduct (Resource 1 and 2). The instructor can engage the learners to think about the components of a code of conduct and develop one that can be a starting point for their codes of conduct. Their institutions may have established codes of conduct that the data steward can use and extend based on their work as a data steward. The instructor should also include elements of accessibility with regard to disability, language, inequality in digital access and overview of practical tools that enable accessibility in the presentation (Resource 3). Group work (optional): The facilitator can guide the participants in developing a code of conduct that will be used and adhered to during the course of trainings. This is an optional activity depending on the level of detail the instructor wants to cover in this training. The resources provide ample information to guide this activity. Activity: The aim is to get the participants to discuss and learn about how to deal with codes of conduct issues while facilitating trainings and workshops. The facilitator can adapt this exercise based on first-hand experiences and other established guidance.
