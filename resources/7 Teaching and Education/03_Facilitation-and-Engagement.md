### Instructor Notes

**Presentation:**

- The instructor can introduce the importance of engagement during a training. The instructor can discuss how repetition (in different ways) is useful for remembering concepts such as using written text to back up speech because hearing **and** seeing helps to remember concepts.
- Engaging the participants - Introduce the idea of the trainer as a performer and how to keep the attention of learners which can vary depending the modality of the training (face to face versus online). Little tricks could include varying speech patterns, tone, and intonation.
- The instructor should address that teaching adults is different from teaching children and discuss some key aspects (Resource 1).

**Group work:**

- The trainer can explain how learners are engaged via learning activities. However the trainer can also emphasis to the group how motivation and demotivation works (Resource 1).

**Presentation on codes of conduct:**

- The goal of this session is to help the participants recognise the importance of codes of conduct while performing their roles as facilitators. The session can introduce the participants to the theory of code of conduct (Resource 1 and 2).
- The instructor can engage the learners to think about the components of a code of conduct and develop one that can be a starting point for their codes of conduct. Their institutions may have established codes of conduct that the data steward can use and extend based on their work as a data steward.
- The instructor should also include elements of accessibility with regard to disability, language, inequality in digital access and overview of practical tools that enable accessibility in the presentation (Resource 3).

**Group work (optional):**

- The facilitator can guide the participants in developing a code of conduct that will be used and adhered to during the course of trainings. This is an optional activity depending on the level of detail the instructor wants to cover in this training. The resources provide ample information to guide this activity.

**Activity:**

- The aim is to get the participants to discuss and learn about how to deal with codes of conduct issues while facilitating trainings and workshops.
- The facilitator can adapt this exercise based on first-hand experiences and other established guidance.
