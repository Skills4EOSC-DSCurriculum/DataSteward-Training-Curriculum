# Introduction


## Overall purpose of the section

The training skills section aims to enable a data steward to develop and deliver training to bridge current gaps in researchers and/or support staff's knowledge in Open Science, FAIR and other data management related topics. This section is about how to put a good training together taking into account the target audience, designing appropriate learning objectives and activities, and using and reusing relevant resources while taking into consideration licensing and attribution.

The section consists of three modules:

- Module 1: Lesson Development
- Module 2: Licensing and Copyright of Educational Materials
- Module 3: Facilitation and Engagement
