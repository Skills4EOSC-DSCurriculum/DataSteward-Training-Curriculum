## Overall purpose of the section

Data stewards play a critical role in translating and implementing institutional policies on data and software management. This section aims to equip data stewards with the knowledge and skills to take into account when implementing different policies, regulations, and requirements related to data and software management. Additionally, this section emphasises the importance of aligning policies with strategic goals, and provides insights into managing the complexities of open science while adhering to necessary regulations.

It should be highlighted that policies will differ depending on national and institutional contexts, and examples and case studies from this section are intended to be illustrative. The instructor can adopt more relevant examples to customise this module for the context.

This section consists of three modules:

- Module 1: Awareness of National/Institutional Policies on RDM, Open Science
- Module 2: Translating Institutional Data and Software Policy to Strategy
- Module 3: Balancing benefits of Open Science and Real-Life Data Related Obligations and Restrictions
