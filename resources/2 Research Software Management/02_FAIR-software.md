# Module 2: FAIR Software

!!! warning "This page is currently under construction"

    **The training curriculum is currently undergoing final revisions and quality checks.**
    **All materials will be released shortly.**
    **Until the official release, please refrain from using, distributing, or implementing any part of these resources.**


## Learning Objectives

- **Learning Objective 1 (LO1):** Recognise and apply the FAIR principles in research software management.
- **Learning Objective 2 (LO2):** Distinguish between FAIR and open source software.


## Total Module Duration

1 hour


## Learning Objective 1

LO1: Recognise and apply the FAIR principles in research software management.


### Learning Activities

- **Presentation** (10 mins): slide presentation on FAIR software (a brief presentation can be put together using the given resources, including a slide presentation from the Netherlands eScience Center that can be adapted), and followed by the discussion activity below.
- **Discussion/Mapping Activity** (20 mins): This activity adapted from the Netherlands eScience Center module on "Software in the Scientific Landscape" (Resource 3). Learners should be given the following prompt by the instructor:
    - Choose one of the three examples of software mentioned in the Resource 3 (Comet, PureGoMe, gammaShiny). The software has been described with statements that can be mapped to the FAIR4RS Principles, as elaborated in the table given in the resource, and also discussed in the lecture/slide presentation. With each statement in the software description, identify the principles it maps to, and which facets of the principles it addresses. A single statement may map to multiple facets. Discuss in breakout groups of 3&ndash;4.
    - The instructor may also choose an example of a research software which is relevant in a particular discipline or that has been developed by researchers of your institution. In this case, the instructor can provide a generic description of the software (for instance, which programming language is written in, the use/application, how is it provided), and also provide a set of statements that can be mapped to the FAIR4RS Principles, which describe the software.


### Materials to Prepare

- Slide presentation on FAIR software.
- Brief summaries of the list of software for the discussion activity.


### Instructor Notes

**Presentation/discussion:**

- The slide presentation an activities should broadly cover an overview of the FAIR principles in research software.
- Slides and activity materials from the Netherlands eScience Center can be reused, with attribution provided in accordance with the CC BY 4.0 license.

## Learning Objective 2

LO2: Distinguish between FAIR and open source software.


### Learning Activities

- **Role-Play/Think-Pair-Share Activity** (30 mins): Divide the class in pairs. Each person in the pair will play one role, a researcher and a data professional.
    - They should pick a piece of software you know of or pick one from the following examples, all of which can be found in the Research Software Directory (Resource 1):
        - [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
        - [LitStudy](https://research-software-directory.org/software/litstudy)
        - [Haddock](https://research-software-directory.org/software/haddock3)
        - [worcs](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html)
        - [democracy-topic-modelling](https://research-software-directory.org/software/democracy-topic-modelling)
    - One person (playing as the researcher) takes some time to prepare to present a piece of software, while the other person plays the data professional.
    - You then play out the following situation: A researcher comes to a supporter with their piece of software and asks for support on managing it.
    - Things for the learner playing **the researcher** to be aware of and prepare before the conversation starts:
        - What is the software about? Describe its purpose.
        - Who will use it?
        - What is the expected life cycle of the software?
        - What potential users or applications are untapped?
    - Things for the learner playing the **data professional** to ask about and be able to give support on:
        - Which FAIR principles are addressed?
        - How can the software be made more FAIR?
        - Is the software FOSS (Free and Open Source)?
        - Is there an organisation or person responsible for maintenance?
    - Both people in the pair then together summarise their conclusions about how they assessed the chosen software, with the lens of FAIRness and and FOSS. These assessments are briefly shared by all the pairs with the group in plenum. Some key common distinctions highlighted from the different case studies should be summarised by the trainer, to emphasise the distinction between FAIR and FOSS.
    - Further details are available in Resource 2, a suggested activity from the Netherlands eScience Center, on which this current activity is based.


### Materials to Prepare

- Slides/introductory notes, working document or printouts that the learners can use to guide them through the exercise on what they have to do.


### Instructor Notes

**Activity:**

- The main goal of this Learning Objective and associated exercise is to distinguish between FAIR and Open Source in the context of software.
- A suggested activity from the Netherlands eScience Center course are available to adapt or reuse for this module, as long as it is properly attributed and cited according to the CC BY 4.0 licence. Resource 3 has more details about how to structure a Think-Pair-Share activity.
- The reading material can either be used by the instructor to provide a brief overview as part of the learning activity, or assigned as pre-session reading to the learners.
