# Introduction

!!! warning "This page is currently under construction"

    **The training curriculum is currently undergoing final revisions and quality checks.**
    **All materials will be released shortly.**
    **Until the official release, please refrain from using, distributing, or implementing any part of these resources.**


## Overall purpose of the section

Research Software is an increasingly prevalent component of doing research, especially in the natural, technical and engineering sciences, but also increasingly in the social sciences and humanities. While Data Stewards are not expected to be experts in research software development, in this section we lay out some of the basic components of research software management, which are useful to be aware of when discussing the topic with researchers. The goal of this section is to understand the basics, rather than delving deeply into every step of the research software lifecycle (unless the data steward is or chooses to become a specialist in this topic), and to be able to access resources that can help researchers if they need more detailed information. Most of the information and material is drawn from the Netherlands eScience Center's comprehensive course ["Research Software Support"](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/research-software-support/). The materials of that course are available for re-use (under CC BY 4.0 license) for any instructors and/or data professionals who would like to delve deeper into some or all of the topics (see also their [Github repository](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support)).

This section consists of the following modules:

- Module 1: What is Research Software
- Module 2: FAIR Software
- Module 3: Software Management Plans
- Module 4: Software Development Practices
- Module 5: Software Sharing Practices
