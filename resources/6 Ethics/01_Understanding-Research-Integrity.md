??? info "Quiz Questions"

    1. What are the key components of research integrity?  
       A) Rapid dissemination of research findings.  
       B) Adherence to ethical principles, transparency, and reproducibility (where it applies) in research.  
       C) Efficient allocation of research funds.  
       Correct Answer: B
    2. Which of the following practices is essential for maintaining research integrity?  
       A) Publishing exclusively in high-impact journals.  
       B) Ensuring meticulous documentation, peer review, and ethical compliance throughout the research life cycle.  
       C) Aligning research topics only with funding priorities.  
       Correct Answer: B

- **Presentation/lecture** (15 mins): Slide presentation or lecture outlining the concept of research integrity, and relevant regulations. The instructor can also recap some concepts from the assigned pre-session reading.
- **Group discussion** (40 mins): Small group discussions in breakout groups (3&ndash;5 participants per group).
    1. Divide participants into small groups (3&ndash;5 people).
    2. Assign one scenario per group (or let groups choose one). Each scenario presents a research integrity challenge.
    3. Scenarios (examples):
        - Scenario 1: Authorship Dispute &ndash; A senior researcher adds their name to a paper without contributing significantly.
        - Scenario 2: Data Manipulation &ndash; A researcher slightly tweaks data to make results look more significant.
        - Scenario 3: Peer Review Ethics &ndash; A reviewer shares confidential details of a manuscript with a colleague.
    4. Each group shares their key takeaways of their scenario by considering the following:
        - What are the principles of research integrity at stake?
        - What are the risks or consequences of integrity violations?
        - What best practices should be applied to resolve the issue?


### Materials to Prepare

- Presentation on research integrity (using available Resources 1&ndash;3).
- Group activity: example scenarios or creating additional scenarios based on local context.


### Instructor Notes

**Quiz:**

- Invite the learners to read the materials and take the quiz.
- The instructor can start with the quiz which is a good way to get learners to start thinking of the concept of research integrity on their own.

**Presentation:**

- Provide the learners with an overview of the concept of research integrity including relevant guidelines and legislative frameworks. Outline why it is so important to identify relevant guidelines for a data steward and their role. Raise ethical concerns related to research integrity. Resource 4 could be used to prepare an overview.

**Group activity:**

- Objectives of the activity:
    - Encourage participants to reflect on the principles of research integrity.
    - Identify challenges and best practices for maintaining integrity in research.
    - Develop practical solutions to common dilemmas around research integrity.
