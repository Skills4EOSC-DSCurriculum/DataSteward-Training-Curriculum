# Module 2: Publication and Reuse of Research Outputs within a Multi-Layered Rules Framework


!!! warning "This page is currently under construction"

    **The training curriculum is currently undergoing final revisions and quality checks.**
    **All materials will be released shortly.**
    **Until the official release, please refrain from using, distributing, or implementing any part of these resources.**


## Learning Objectives

- **Learning Objective 1 (LO1):** Identify potential opportunities and obligations related to the publication and reuse of data and other research outputs in adherence to FAIR principles.


## Total Module Duration

1 hour 30 minutes


## Learning Objective 1

LO1: Identify potential opportunities and obligations related to the publication and reuse of data and other research outputs in adherence to FAIR principles.


### Learning Activities

- **Slide presentation/lecture** (60mins): The goal of the lecture is to give data stewards an overview of issues within a multi-layered rules framework, such as licensing of research outputs, publication policies of journals, potential effects of publishing research output, and adjudicating between different licences. The instructor can consult or reuse slides prepared as part of Resource 9, a more in-depth learning path on open licensing.
- **Discussion Activity** (30 mins): In pairs, learners should reflect on the following scenario: A researcher approaches the data steward with a research article and related dataset that they would like to publish in a journal. What advice could you give them on the following points:
    - Why they should share and license their data.
    - What different licence types are available and the implications of each.
    - The benefits (or not) of using open licences.
    - Resource 1 can be used as a guiding document to discuss the importance of licences and how to choose them. The Creative Commons License Chooser (Resource 4) can also be used as a tool for this exercise.


### Materials to Prepare

- Slide presentation on overview of sharing data and licensing.
- Questions and prompts to guide the discussion activity (some examples provided in Instructor Notes).


### Instructor Notes

**Content Overview for presentation/lecture:**

- The purpose and main approaches towards protection of research outputs
- The multi-layered framework (IPR, national rules, open licenses)
- The societal significance of ensuring FAIR publication
- Main rules affecting the licensing of research outputs, including national copyright laws, internal rules and policies at the level of the organisation
- Considerations for licence compatibility in Open Licensing (instructor could go over licensing issues in a brief/introductory way, and refer to Resource 9 for more detailed course on licensing)
- When Open Access is mandatory: Discussing the example of Horizon projects
- The limits of openness: when to consider opting out from Text and Data Mining under the Copyright and Digital Single Market (CDSM) Directive

**Discussion activity:**

- Instructors can adapt the discussion to their local context and point to specific journals relevant to their group.
- What questions or additional information might a data steward need to give tailored advice on these topics? This should be emphasised as something for learners to consider as they begin the activity. Some of these could be:
    - What are the requirements of the journal?
    - What are the policies in their home institutions?
    - What kind of data (personal data, sensitive data, dual use, and so on) is in the dataset and how would that impact the licences being applied?
    - What is the goal of the researcher in sharing their data? How do they envision it being reused?
    - When should data not be shared?

**Additional materials:**

- A more detailed (intermediate level) learning path on Open Licensing intended for Data Stewards and Data Professionals has also been developed in the Skills4EOSC project, and if instructors choose, they can use either parts or all of this material to go into more depth or point learners towards additional resources. It covers issues such as adapting content to local contexts, applying licences throughout projects, complying with funder and institutional requirements, and aligning with research discipline and project aims. See Resource 9 for details.
