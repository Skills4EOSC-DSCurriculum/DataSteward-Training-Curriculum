# Module 3: Exploitation and Dissemination Assessments in EU Projects


## Learning Objectives

- **Learning Objective 1 (LO1):** Recognise the significance of dissemination and exploitation of results in EU-funded projects.


## Total Module Duration

1 hour (excluding pre-session activity)


## Learning Objective 1

LO1: Recognise the significance of dissemination and exploitation of results in EU-funded projects.


### Learning Activities

- **Pre-session activity**: This entails learners following the self-paced online materials (Resource&nbsp;1, pp.&nbsp;33-40) as well as preparing preliminary considerations for exploitation of research they consider relevant in their field.
- **Lecture** (60&nbsp;mins) to cover the basics of exploitation and dissemination activities, the structure and role of an assessment and the dissemination and exploitation of results.


### Materials to Prepare

- Slides for the lecture on dissemination and exploitation of results.


### Instructor Notes

- The role of this module is to create general awareness about the basics of dissemination and exploitation of results in EU-funded projects, including (but also beyond) the Horizon framework. It's important to keep in mind that guidance on Horizon is constantly evolving, and the links and discussions here are illustrative of existing guidance in 2025.
- Data stewards in many institutions may not be involved with the exploitation and dissemination of results, or may advise on some aspects of it. We include a basic overview of the topic here for data stewards to have a general awareness. If the instructor feels that this module is not relevant for their cohort of trainees, it can be made optional or removed entirely.
- As defined in the Horizon Europe Guide (Resource&nbsp;1), 'dissemination' means 'the public disclosure of the results by appropriate means (other than resulting from protecting or exploiting the results), including by scientific publications in any medium'. 'Exploitation', on the other hand, refers to 'the use of results in further research and innovation activities other than those covered by the action concerned, including among other things, commercial exploitation such as developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in standardisation activities'.
- The aim is to show dissemination as both an obligation and opportunity: in order to further scale-up the results, to raise awareness about the value created and the positive impacts in other fields.

**Pre-session preparatory activity:**

- Learners are expected to read the mandatory section of Resources&nbsp;1&ndash;5.
- Recommended additional materials are provided as Resources&nbsp;6&ndash;9.

**Lecture:**

The lecture should cover the following points:

- **Basic concepts:** what is dissemination, exploitation, what is to be understood as results?
- **Planning for dissemination and exploitation:**
    - Identification of the problem the research seeks to address
    - Review of the current offer, such as products offered by existing providers
    - Building a description of the added value of the research (new methodology, new technology, etc.) and the Key Exploitable Results (KER)
    - Difference between outcome and expected impact
    - Identification of target groups/early adopters and dissemination channels
    - Describing exploitation measures to demonstrate Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
    - What will be the expected results? In case the results lead to developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan should include a strategy for such exploitation.
    - Setting forth a framework for exploitation of results in the consortium agreement, including intellectual property management, as well as anticipating and avoiding possible issues
    - Describing impact on policymaking and contribution to EU priorities
    - Inclusion of potential end-users and stakeholders
    - Prognosis for future exploitation of results, including the broader impact and envisaged value brought in other areas
    - Implementation of Open Science practices
- **Further considerations during/after the project activities:**
    - Dissemination of research results and notice obligations to other beneficiaries. When can beneficiaries object to dissemination? What is the role of legitimate interests?
    - The obligation to exploit research results under Horizon projects and the role of booster tools provided by the Commission, including the Horizon Results Platform or the Horizon Results Booster.
- **Definition and role of communication:**
    - Planning communication activities at the stage of the proposal
    - Defining communication objectives
- **Results ownership and IP management:**
    - The significance of clarifying results ownership
        - Avoiding risks related to IP rights
        - Evaluation of the proposal
        - Attracting investors
        - Reporting obligations
