# Introduction


## Overall purpose of the section

The goal of this section is to equip data stewards with knowledge and resources about usage rights and licensing issues, and to apply these while giving advice to researchers. Depending on institutional and national context, as well as discipline, there may be other experts who are tasked with giving researchers more detailed advice on these issues, however, we still felt it was important to make data stewards aware of the basics, and point to resources that can help them navigate issues in more detail, if needed.

This section consists of three modules:

- Module 1: Getting Familiar with EU Copyright Law and Data and Digital Legislation
- Module 2: Publication and Reuse of Research Outputs within a Multi-Layered Rules Framework
- Module 3: Exploitation and Dissemination Assessments in EU Projects
