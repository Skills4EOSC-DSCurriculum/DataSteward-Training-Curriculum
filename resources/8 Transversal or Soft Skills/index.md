# Introduction

!!! warning "This page is currently under construction"

    **The training curriculum is currently undergoing final revisions and quality checks.**
    **All materials will be released shortly.**
    **Until the official release, please refrain from using, distributing, or implementing any part of these resources.**

## Overall purpose of the section

This section aims to help develop transversal or soft skills that will form the basis of mediation, communication, networking and support work of the data steward. Through skill development, the data steward will be able to create links between researchers, computer scientists, archivists and other contributors, to get people working together towards a common goal.

Soft skills are by definition difficult to teach, so much of the material in this section focuses on discussion, role play activities, and prompts to get data stewards thinking about the kinds of soft skills they will be using in their roles, rather than providing definitive instruction. The section should be thought of as a starting point to build awareness about the importance of soft skills in data stewardship.

The terms transversal/soft skills are both used here. While transversal aligns with the [ESCO definition](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/about-esco/escopedia/escopedia/transversal-knowledge-skills-and-competences) and also the MVS for data stewards, soft skills is a more well-used and recognisable term, and we have continued to use it for this reason in this section.

This section consists of three modules:

- Module 1: Advocacy &ndash; Building Soft Skills for Impact
- Module 2: Mediation and Community &ndash; Liaison and Networking
- Module 3: Efficient Communication (Written, Verbal and Visual)
