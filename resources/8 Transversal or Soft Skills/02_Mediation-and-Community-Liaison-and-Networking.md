- **Learning Objective 3 (LO3):** Identify actions necessary for teamwork in a network.


## Total Module Duration

1 hour 50 minutes (without optional activities)


## Learning Objective 1

LO1: Identify effective ways to develop networking skills and understand their importance.


### Learning Activities

- **Brainstorming** (20 mins): The instructor asks the learners what networking is to them, how they implement it as part of their work, what difficulties they encounter. The discussion can include: how to develop a professional network (identify individual needs, use social networks) how to go about it and what the key success factors are (try to meet lot of people, be bold, share information, take part in seminars).
- **Presentation** (30 mins): The instructor introduces what networking is and why networking is important.
- **Optional activity** (15 mins): The instructor can propose to the learners the idea of building their own network. Discuss the key aspects of starting a network before introducing Resource 1.


### Materials to Prepare

- Slide presentation on what networking is and why it is important.
- Printouts or handouts if any materials from Resource 2 (Refer to Deeper Dives 3) are being shared to be used within the training session.


### Instructor Notes

**Brainstorm and Presentation:**

- Start with a brainstorm to ask the learners what a network is.
- In the presentation, define networking and its different aspects, such as developing and maintaining mutually beneficial relationships. Some aspects of networking are: exchanging knowledge, contacts, references, giving advice, support, recommendations, being attentive to the needs of others (identify who in my network could meet the need). Emphasise that networking is above all a question of generosity and attentiveness: you have to give in order to receive. A template such as Resource 2 can help the instructor plan for this presentation OR be shared with learners to start thinking about their network.
- The instructor can also discuss what the data steward should do to participate activity in the network such as: a willingness to seek collaborative solutions to solve problems, a sense of service and support, share information, openness, transparency etc.

**Optional activity:**

- The trainer can propose to learners to build their own network (Resource 1).

## Learning Objective 2

LO2: Identify (discipline-specific) experts to develop knowledge and connect people at institutional, national and international levels.


### Learning Activities

- **Round table** (10 mins): The trainer asks the learners what their original scientific disciplines are, what networks they identified during their career path in research and how they identified them at the time.
- **Discussion** (10 mins): How can I benefit from professional networks or working groups? Why should I get involved ?
- **(Optional) Video presentation** (10 mins): Testimonials of networking examples.


### Materials to Prepare

- Slide presentation on examples of networking and international/European working groups and task forces.
- Video testimonials on networking examples (if possible).


### Instructor Notes

- The instructor can introduce examples of networks, working groups or task forces set up by international European institutions/infrastructures (Resource 1). The instructor can highlight the importance of building a professional environment and a network of partners (For the data steward and the scientific teams they support).
- If the instructor has testimonials from participants in national, European and international networks and working groups presenting the benefit of being part of the group, this would be a great addition to the discussion. Or the instructor could facilitate directly testimonials from the learners (and use these for future trainings).

- **Group activity** (30 mins): Form groups to brainstorm on what are the main tasks/roles and qualities of a good network coordinator. The whole session then gets together to share their ideas.  
  **Summarise**: Guide or check list of the best behaviours to adopt as a network or working group coordinator (listening, encouraging exchanges through conviviality, highlighting positive results, making information easily accessible, fostering a collaborative environment).


### Materials to Prepare

- Slide presentation on being a network coordinator.


### Instructor Notes

**Brainstorm and group activity:**
