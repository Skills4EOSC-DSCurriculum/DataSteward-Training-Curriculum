# Module 6: Data Sharing and Publication

!!! warning "This page is currently under construction"

    **The training curriculum is currently undergoing final revisions and quality checks.**
    **All materials will be released shortly.**
    **Until the official release, please refrain from using, distributing, or implementing any part of these resources.**


## Learning Objectives

- **Learning Objective 1 (LO1):** Recognise the benefits, requirements, and limitations of sharing/publishing data.
- **Learning Objective 2 (LO2):** Identify different forms of data publication and infrastructure to make outputs discoverable.


## Total Module Duration

2 hours 45 minutes


## Learning Objective 1

LO1: Recognise the benefits, requirements, and limitations of sharing/publishing data.


### Learning Activities

- **Lecture** (45 mins): Prepare a lecture on the benefits of data sharing/publication for researchers, the research community, funders, and the public. The lecture can also cover limitations (confidentiality, industrial exploitation, data protection) and what to do if the data cannot be made publicly available (for example, archive data and publish metadata with access rules). Requirements from institutional policies, funders and publishers (like data availability statements) should also be addressed.
- **Group Discussion** (30 mins): Learners are confronted with a case in which a researcher resists sharing data and they need to provide arguments to convince the researcher. The activity can be done in small breakout groups, with results from each group discussed in plenum.


### Materials to Prepare

- Presentation slides on benefits, limitations, and requirements of data sharing and publication.
- Prepare a small input for the group task. The input should describe a detailed scenario of a researcher who is reluctant to sharing his data. Include some specific arguments from the researcher that the learners need to refute.


### Instructor Notes

**Lecture:**

- These are some of the key takeaways the instructor needs to cover in their presentation (see Resources 1&ndash;10 for information and inspiration):
    - Sharing data promotes collaboration, accelerates discoveries, and supports evidence-based decision-making across disciplines.
    - Open data allows for verification of results, reducing errors, bias, and misconduct in research and data-driven initiatives.
    - While open data drives progress, responsible sharing requires balancing openness with privacy, security, and proprietary concerns.
    - Sometimes there are recommendations on where to publish your data.
    - Making sure that guidelines from different stakeholders are known and followed is important to not violate any laws or good scientific practice (see Resources 11&ndash;14 for examples). 
- If the audience is known, search for relevant requirements from institution/funders/publishers for the audience (see generic example requirements under Resources).
- For further details about repositories and data infrastructure, please also refer to the module *Data Preservation and Archiving* of this curriculum.

## Learning Objective 2

LO2: Identify different forms of data publication and infrastructure to make outputs discoverable.


### Learning Activities

- **Lecture** (45 mins): Lecture on different forms of data publication, infrastructures, persistent identifiers. The lecture should include a live demonstration of publishing data to some demo infrastructure.
- **Discussion activity** (45 mins): Learners should take a dataset from their research and:
    - Choose the best form and license for publishing their dataset (take into consideration possible relevant laws or guidelines from institutions).
    - Find a data journal suitable for a given dataset.
    - Create a network of different related publications (datasets, research papers, software); the publications may not yet exist, but can also be planned for the future.


### Materials to Prepare

- Presentation slides on data publication, infrastructures, persistent identifiers.
- Prepare notes and practice live demonstration of publishing a dataset to a demo repository (for example, Zenodo Sandbox, see Resource 18).
- If available, learners should bring their own datasets for the discussion activity. If they do not have any datasets, the instructor should prepare some sample datasets that can be used by the learners.

                - TRUST principles
            - Certification
                - CoreTrustSeal
        - Data journals (see Resources 27&ndash;30)

        - ORCID
        - Accession numbers (for library collections)
- If applicable, adopt license part to country specific legislation.
- If available, include research data policy from the home institution or discipline of the learners.

**Discussion:**

- Discuss the advantages of different publication forms. No single form of data publication fits all needs. Researchers should select the most appropriate (or combine multiple) method(s) based on their goals, the nature of their data, and disciplinary norms:
    - Use dataset repositories when enabling direct access and reuse is a priority.
    - Publish a data paper when contextualisation and academic recognition are important.
    - Attach supplementary materials when data primarily supports a research article without independent reuse.
- Assessing FAIRness (for instance with F-UJI or FAIReva, see Resources 34, 35) ensures compliance with best practices, making data more useful for future research and innovation.
- A clear data license defines how others can access, use, and build upon research. Selecting the right license balances openness with necessary restrictions, fostering trust and ethical reuse while protecting intellectual contributions.
- Data citations, just like research article citations, give proper credit to data creators and encourage responsible reuse.
- Connecting datasets to code, research software, and publications provides the provenance of the research process and help the advancement of science. Breaking a single big journal publication containing everything into these smaller pieces values each step of the research process; the researcher does not only focus on publishing interpretations, but also puts effort into data collection and publishing. This supports reproducibility, verification, and reuse.
- If the audience is known, modify the examples for the discussion to match the discipline or institution of the learners.
